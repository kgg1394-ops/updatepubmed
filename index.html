            <div class="abs">The role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly aspirin, in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer remains controversial. The debate over aspirin use is driven by the challenge of balancing uncertain preventive benefits against the risks of adverse effects. Given the inconsistent findings from clinical trials and conflicting clinical guidelines, a rigorous and updated systematic review is necessary to clarify the evidence base.<br><br>To assess the benefits and harms of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, for preventing colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal adenoma (CRA) in the general population.<br><br>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two clinical trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP) on 3 March 2025.<br><br>We included parallel-group or factorial-design randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing aspirin and other NSAIDs with either no treatment or a different treatment for preventing CRC or CRA in the general population.<br><br>Our critical outcomes were CRC incidence and serious adverse events (SAE). Our important outcomes included CRC mortality, CRA incidence, serious extracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke. When data were available, we categorized findings into prespecified follow-up intervals: 5 to < 10 years, 10 to < 15 years, and ≥ 15 years.<br><br>We assessed the risk of bias for study outcomes as high risk, some concerns, or low risk, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.<br><br>We synthesized data for each outcome using random-effects meta-analysis. For time-dependent outcomes, we prioritized time-to-event data, calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When these were unavailable, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratios (RRs). For rare outcomes, we calculated Peto odds ratios (ORs) using a fixed-effect model. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.<br><br>We included 10 RCTs involving a total of 124,837 participants. These studies compared aspirin with either placebo or no treatment for the primary prevention of CRC. Low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg per day) was typically used, though three studies evaluated higher doses. The studies were mostly conducted in Europe and North America. One study had sites in Australia, and there were two large studies conducted in Japan. Seven studies reported long-term results with extended observational follow-up where blinding had ceased. We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs by the general population for primary CRC prevention.<br><br>For the comparison of aspirin versus inactive control in the general population, we rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to high. We downgraded the certainty level for several outcomes due primarily to risk of bias and imprecision. Regarding CRC incidence, aspirin probably results in little to no difference at follow-up ≥ 5 to < 10 years (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24; 3 studies, 26,702 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and at ≥ 10 to < 15 years (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.17; 2 studies, 42,412 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Aspirin may reduce CRC incidence slightly at follow-up ≥ 15 years (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.91; 3 studies, 47,464 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding CRC mortality, aspirin may increase mortality at follow-up ≥ 5 to < 10 years (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.07; 1 study, 19,114 participants; low-certainty evidence), may result in little to no difference in mortality at follow-up ≥ 10 years and < 15 years (Peto OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.78; 1 study, 39,876 participants; low-certainty evidence), but may reduce mortality at follow-up ≥ 15 years (Peto OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90; 5 studies, 53,909 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding CRA incidence, aspirin may result in little to no difference in CRA incidence at ≥ 5 to < 10 years of follow-up (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.87; 1 study, 12,546 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding safety, although aspirin probably results in little to no difference in overall SAE (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 3 studies, 16,442 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), aspirin does increase the risk of serious extracranial hemorrhage (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.95; 8 studies, 97,567 participants; high-certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (Peto OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.77; 8 studies, 105,037 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).<br><br>It is not possible to draw definitive conclusions or outline specific implications for the routine use of aspirin for CRC primary prevention based on the current evidence. Our findings reveal complex, time-dependent preventive effects and concerns about potential harms for clinicians and patients to consider. Evidence of very low to moderate certainty shows little to no benefit for CRC or CRA incidence in the first 15 years, and low-certainty evidence suggests a potential increase in CRC mortality in the first 5 to 10 years. Very low-certainty evidence suggests potential benefits for CRC incidence and mortality after long-term follow-up (≥ 15 years), but these potential long-term benefits are derived from findings in the observational follow-up phases of RCTs, where standard intention-to-treat analyses are not robust to post-randomization confounding from factors such as treatment contamination. The uncertain and delayed potential for benefit must be weighed against a definite harm. While aspirin probably has little to no effect on overall serious adverse events (moderate-certainty evidence), it increases the risk of serious extracranial hemorrhage (high-certainty evidence) and probably increases the risk of serious extracranial hemorrhage (moderate-certainty evidence). In light of the mixed evidence, clinical practice should continue to center on an individualized assessment and a shared decision-making process, carefully balancing a patient's established cardiovascular risk profile against their risk of bleeding.<br><br>This Cochrane review was funded (in part) by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2024M752248) and the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (Grade A) of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (BX20230244).<br><br>Protocol available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015266.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pivotal cytokine driving intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The development of monoclonal antibodies selectively targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, including risankizumab, mirikizumab and guselkumab, has significantly expanded the therapeutic landscape of IBD. Landmark phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have demonstrated high efficacy and durable responses, followed by recent regulatory approvals across both indications. Notably, the SEQUENCE trial established the superiority of risankizumab over ustekinumab in achieving endoscopic and clinical endpoints in CD, underscoring the therapeutic value of IL-23p19 blockade and its differentiation from prior p40 inhibition. With additional agents in advanced development, IL-23p19 inhibitors are now emerging as a bona fide treatment class in IBD. Furthermore, IL-23p19 inhibitors display favorable safety profiles and convenient subcutaneous administration regimens, which broaden their applicability across diverse patient populations. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal treatment positioning, comparative effectiveness, and long-term disease outcomes. Precision medicine approaches will be crucial to fully exploit the potential of this drug class. For instance, early biomarkers can help monitor response, while future integration of serological and multi-omics biomarkers may enable the prediction of treatment success and guide personalized selection. This review summarizes the current knowledge base regarding IL-23p19 inhibitors in IBD, highlights their class effects and unique clinical value, and outlines a research agenda towards biomarker-driven and precision-guided use. Ultimately, IL-23p19-inhibition exemplifies how targeted immunotherapy and precision medicine can converge in order to reshape IBD management.</div>

In light of the mixed evidence, clinical practice should continue to center on an individualized assessment and a shared decision-making process, carefully balancing a patient's established cardiovascular risk profile against their risk of bleeding.<br><br>This Cochrane review was funded (in part) by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2024M752248) and the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (Grade A) of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (BX20230244).<br><br>Protocol available via doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015266.</div>

            <div class="abs">The survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains unproven, whereas total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) incorporating preoperative chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcomes. However, the total chemotherapy duration delivered across neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases varies substantially in clinical practice. We investigated the impact of total chemotherapy duration in the STELLAR trial.<br><br>This post hoc analysis was based on the phase III randomized trial, comparing short-course radiotherapy followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (TNT) with long-course chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LARC patients. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with available chemotherapy duration data were included, with a median follow-up of 68.1 months. Patients were categorized: group 1 (no chemotherapy, n = 121), group 2 (3 to 12 weeks, n = 113), group 3 (15 weeks, n = 30), and group 4 (≥ 18 weeks, n = 275). Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM), and locoregional recurrence (LRR) were assessed using time-dependent Cox regression.<br><br>Group 4 achieved the highest 5-year OS (82.1%) and DFS (66.0%) rates. Compared with groups 1 and 2, group 4 demonstrated significantly improved OS (adj. P ≤ 0.001) and improved DFS versus group 1 (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.443-0.870, adj. P = 0.017). In the TNT cohort, group 4 was associated with significantly improved OS and DFS compared with group 2 (adj. P < 0.01), but not with group 3. Additionally, group 4 showed a significantly lower risk of LRR than group 3. In the CRT cohort, group 4 was associated with improved OS compared with group 1 (adj.

The Research and Development (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness method (RAM) was used to evaluate candidate statements across 5 domains: pretraining activities, structure of training programs, POEM-specific cognitive training, POEM-specific technical training, and assessment of competence. Experts participated in 2 rounds of voting, rating each statement on a 9-point scale from highly inappropriate (1) to highly appropriate (9). For each statement, the median score and mean absolute deviation from the median were calculated. A statement was considered appropriate if it received a median score ≥7 and met the criteria for appropriateness based on the BIOMED, Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry, and P value methods.<br><br>Of the 40 proposed statements, 34 met the criteria as appropriate. Key recommendations included that trainees should undergo POEM training within programs performing at least 40 procedures annually, be mentored by at least 1 trainer with ≥100 prior POEMs, and complete a minimum of 15 POEMs before undergoing milestone assessments with a validated assessment tool. Cognitive requirements included mastery of mediastinal anatomy, GERD management, electrosurgical tools, and interpretation of motility and imaging studies. Simulation model training and exposure to esophageal POEM, gastric POEM, and Zenker POEM were also recommended.<br><br>This consensus effort provides evidence-based minimum standards for POEM training, applicable to both GI and surgical trainees.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pivotal cytokine driving intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The development of monoclonal antibodies selectively targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, including risankizumab, mirikizumab and guselkumab, has significantly expanded the therapeutic landscape of IBD. Landmark phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have demonstrated high efficacy and durable responses, followed by recent regulatory approvals across both indications. Notably, the SEQUENCE trial established the superiority of risankizumab over ustekinumab in achieving endoscopic and clinical endpoints in CD, underscoring the therapeutic value of IL-23p19 blockade and its differentiation from prior p40 inhibition. With additional agents in advanced development, IL-23p19 inhibitors are now emerging as a bona fide treatment class in IBD. Furthermore, IL-23p19 inhibitors display favorable safety profiles and convenient subcutaneous administration regimens, which broaden their applicability across diverse patient populations. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal treatment positioning, comparative effectiveness, and long-term disease outcomes. Precision medicine approaches will be crucial to fully exploit the potential of this drug class. For instance, early biomarkers can help monitor response, while future integration of serological and multi-omics biomarkers may enable the prediction of treatment success and guide personalized selection. This review summarizes the current knowledge base regarding IL-23p19 inhibitors in IBD, highlights their class effects and unique clinical value, and outlines a research agenda towards biomarker-driven and precision-guided use. Ultimately, IL-23p19-inhibition exemplifies how targeted immunotherapy and precision medicine can converge in order to reshape IBD management.</div>

The development of monoclonal antibodies selectively targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, including risankizumab, mirikizumab and guselkumab, has significantly expanded the therapeutic landscape of IBD. Landmark phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have demonstrated high efficacy and durable responses, followed by recent regulatory approvals across both indications. Notably, the SEQUENCE trial established the superiority of risankizumab over ustekinumab in achieving endoscopic and clinical endpoints in CD, underscoring the therapeutic value of IL-23p19 blockade and its differentiation from prior p40 inhibition. With additional agents in advanced development, IL-23p19 inhibitors are now emerging as a bona fide treatment class in IBD. Furthermore, IL-23p19 inhibitors display favorable safety profiles and convenient subcutaneous administration regimens, which broaden their applicability across diverse patient populations. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal treatment positioning, comparative effectiveness, and long-term disease outcomes. Precision medicine approaches will be crucial to fully exploit the potential of this drug class. For instance, early biomarkers can help monitor response, while future integration of serological and multi-omics biomarkers may enable the prediction of treatment success and guide personalized selection. This review summarizes the current knowledge base regarding IL-23p19 inhibitors in IBD, highlights their class effects and unique clinical value, and outlines a research agenda towards biomarker-driven and precision-guided use. Ultimately, IL-23p19-inhibition exemplifies how targeted immunotherapy and precision medicine can converge in order to reshape IBD management.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, with high mortality rates worldwide. The optimal treatment strategy for patients with multinodular early-stage HCC (BCLC-A) is still controversial, particularly regarding liver resection (LR), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with multinodular BCLC-A HCC treated with LR compared to RFA and TACE. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies comparing LR with RFA and TACE. Pooled analyses of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were performed using Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fifteen studies, including two randomized controlled trials and 13 cohort studies, with a total of 2,869 patients, were included. LR was significantly associated with improved OS (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.03-1.84; p = 0.01) and DFS (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.26-3.70; p = 0.001) compared with RFA. Similarly, LR demonstrated superior OS (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.37-3.25; p < 0.0001) and DFS (HR 2.77; 95% CI 1.04-7.36; p = 0.04) when compared with TACE. The more pronounced benefit observed for DFS likely reflects improved local tumor control achieved with surgical resection. In selected patients with multinodular BCLC-A HCC and preserved liver function (predominantly Child-Pugh A or B), LR is associated with significant improvements in OS and DFS compared with RFA and TACE when liver transplantation is not feasible. These findings support reconsideration of current treatment algorithms to prioritize LR in appropriately selected candidates.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>This study aimed to investigate the effects of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on pathological scar formation, following median sternotomy, focusing on the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in tissue remodelling and wound healing. Designed as a cross-sectional observational study, it included 100 patients who had undergone median sternotomy at least 6 months prior and were receiving continuous antihypertensive treatment. Patients were categorised into three groups based on their medications: ACEIs (n = 33), ARBs (n = 35), and other antihypertensives (n = 32). Scar formation was evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS v2.0), which assesses both subjective and objective parameters. The study showed that keloid formation was significantly less common in the ACEI (24.2%) and ARB (25.7%) groups compared to the group using other antihypertensives (53.1%, p = 0.021). Both OSAS and PSAS total scores were significantly lower in the ACEI and ARB groups (p = 0.036 and p = 0.042, respectively). Among OSAS subparameters, vascularization (p = 0.005), pigmentation (p = 0.012), thickness (p = 0.010), and surface appearance (p = 0.007) were significantly improved in the ACEI and ARB groups. Among PSAS subparameters, pain (p = 0.003), stiffness (p = 0.021), thickness (p = 0.013), and irregularity (p = 0.025) were significantly lower in these groups compared to the other antihypertensives group. Our findings suggest that ACEIs and ARBs, commonly used for hypertension, may be associated with improved scar quality and a reduced tendency for keloid formation. These medications could represent a promising and cost-effective alternative to traditional scar treatments, particularly in hypertensive patients. However, given the cross-sectional design of our study and the variability in postoperative durations among patients, these findings should be interpreted as exploratory. While associations were observed, causality remains uncertain. Further larger, prospective, randomised controlled studies with standardised evaluation times and detailed information on medications and dosages are needed to better clarify the potential role of ACEIs and ARBs in scar management.</div>

NAFP induction resulted in GPX4 downregulation (0.471 ± 0.357 vs. 1.197 ± 0.449, P < 0.05), ACSL4 upregulation (48.633 ± 40.998 vs. 1.197 ± 0.445, p < 0.001), elevated NLRP3 (12.717 ± 7.904 vs. 1.115 ± 0.186, p < 0.001), and increased rno-miR-762 expression. The combination therapy achieved 73 % reduction in pancreatic adipocyte area (vs. 42 % with monotherapies, p < 0.001) through coordinated miR-762 suppression (↓68 %, q=0.003) and GPX4 protein restoration (↑2.1-fold, p = 0.008). NLRP3 inflammasome activity decreased by 89 % (p = 0.004). Crucially, the regimen preserved hemodynamic stability, demonstrating metabolic benefits without cardiovascular compromise.<br><br>These findings position miR-762 as a linchpin biomarker connecting metabolic stress to ferroptotic pancreatitis, with clinical translation challenges. This work provides the first evidence that sub-therapeutic calcium-RAS crosstalk modulation can reverse established pancreatic steatosis while outlining a precision medicine framework for NAFP prevention.</div>

            <div class="abs">Patients with gastric cancer, biliary tract cancer (BTC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have poor survival outcomes and limited second- or later-line treatment options. Certain drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) signaling pathways are currently used in these cancers in specific circumstances; however, there remains a need for novel treatment combinations. LEAP-005 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 study that evaluated lenvatinib (multitargeted inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including VEGF) plus pembrolizumab (anti‒PD-1 monoclonal antibody) in select previously treated solid tumors.<br><br>Participants with previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC were enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G of LEAP-005, respectively, and received lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety.<br><br>Of 99, 102, and 103 total participants enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G, respectively, median times from first dose of study treatment to data cutoff (February 6, 2023) were 23.7, 24.2, and 19.5 months. ORRs (95% CI) by blinded independent central review were 15.2% (8.7%‒23.8%) in cohort C, 17.6% (10.8%‒26.4%) in cohort F, and 7.8% (3.4%‒14.7%) in cohort G. Grade 3‒5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54.5% of participants in cohort C, and grade 3‒4 (no grade 5) occurred in 60.8% and 59.2% of participants in cohorts F and G, respectively.<br><br>Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated modest antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>While some retrospective studies have reported that certain dietary habits may affect pancreatic cancer, the variety of dietary habits studied has been limited. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using exposure data from the UK Biobank data (n = 10,019,305) and outcome data from the FinnGen database (731 pancreatic cancer cases and 314,193 controls). Instrumental variables were selected based on genome-wide significance, followed by linkage disequilibrium clumping. Sensitivity analyses, including Steiger filtering and MR-PRESSO, were conducted to ensure the robustness of the causal inferences. Following this process, we extracted and filtered the data, ultimately selecting 30 dietary phenotypes from the original 231. Our findings revealed that alcohol intake frequency (raw P-value =.002, odds ratio (OR) = 1.090, 95% CI: 1.032-1.151) and average weekly spirits intake (raw P-value = .005, OR = 1.793, 95% CI: 1.196-2.688) were risk factors for pancreatic cancer using data from 706 single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from FinnGen database. Notably, cooked vegetable intake (raw P-value = .029, OR = 0.704, 95% CI: 0.514-0.965) was found to have a protective effect against pancreatic cancer. Our MR analysis provides evidence that specific dietary habits significantly influence pancreatic cancer risk, highlighting the potential of dietary interventions within public health strategies for pancreatic cancer management.</div>
