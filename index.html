                <div class="abs">The prognostic value of lymph node (LN) yield in esophageal and gastric cancer remains controversial, especially in the context of modern perioperative treatment. This multicenter Danish cohort study evaluates the association between LN yield and survival outcomes. This study included 3092 patients who underwent curative-intent resection for esophageal (n = 2402) or gastric cancer (n = 690) between 2013 and 2021 at four Danish upper GI centers. All cases were registered in the Danish Esophagogastric Cancer Group database, covering 99% of all Danish esophageal and gastric cancer cases. Patients were stratified by nodal status (pN0/pN+) and categorized into five LN yield groups. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. In node-negative esophageal cancer, higher LN yields (20-29, 30-39, and 40+) were significantly associated with improved survival (hazard ratio: 0.47-0.58, P < 0.001) compared with the reference group (16-19). No survival benefit was seen beyond 16-19 nodes in node-positive esophageal or gastric cancers. Perioperative chemotherapy improved survival in node-positive esophageal cancer but had no effect in node-negative esophageal and gastric cancer. Discrepancies between clinical and pathological nodal staging were frequent and influenced both survival estimates and treatment allocation. LN removal was associated with survival in esophageal and gastric cancer. Node-negative patients showed increased survival if ≥20 nodes were removed, while node-positive esophageal cancer and gastric cancer patients showed no difference in survival beyond 16-19. Lastly, discrepancies between clinical and pathological staging underscore the need for more accurate preoperative diagnostics and highlight the impact of modern perioperative chemotherapy.</div>

                <div class="abs">Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in remission require monitoring, but optimal timing for endoscopic assessment is unknown. We aimed to assess variability in time from remission to surveillance endoscopy and associations with disease outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with EoE who achieved histologic remission (<15 eos/hpf) while on stable treatment and had at least one surveillance endoscopy with biopsy after remission. Time to surveillance was categorized (≤1 year, 1-2 years, >2 years) and compared to a range of EoE clinicopathologic characteristics and disease outcomes. The 91-patient cohort had substantial variability in time to first surveillance endoscopy (mean 1.3 ± 1.0 years; median/IQR 1.0/0.6-1.8; range 0.2-7.3). While most patient characteristics were not associated with time to surveillance, larger dilation size at remission correlated with longer surveillance intervals (R = 0.36, p = 0.03), and EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) was inversely associated (R = -0.21, p = 0.07). Outcomes of EREFS, Index of Severity of EoE, and eosinophil count were similar for <1, 1-2, or 2+ years surveillance intervals. However, numerically fewer patients with endoscopy 2+ years after remission maintained histologic response (59% vs. 78% at ≤1 year and 82% at 1-2 years; p = 0.15) and had more ongoing EoE symptoms (47% vs. 34% at ≤1 year and 24% at 1-2 years; p = 0.26). Surveillance timing in EoE remission varies widely and is largely unexplained by clinical features, except for dilation size. While outcomes were similar across intervals, patients with longer surveillance (>2 years) had numerically less histologic response and more persistent symptoms, warranting further study.</div>

Tumor heterogeneity, driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations, undermines the efficacy of conventional therapies and limits the long-term success of targeted agents. There is an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that can exploit, rather than be constrained by, this heterogeneity.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> We developed a personalized immunotherapeutic pipeline in the syngeneic CT26 murine model of CRC. Briefly, whole exome sequencing identified mutated surface proteins (MSPs) unique to these cells. Of these MSPs, we selected 10 for the generation of MSP-specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). These pAbs were tested for specificity and peptide binding to peptides via ELISA, tumor tissue by immunofluorescence, and tumor cells by flow cytometry. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo using CT26 tumor-bearing mice treated with the pAb cocktail alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. To assess clinical relevance, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole exome sequencing data from 100 human CRC patients for MSP prevalence and inter-patient variability.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> The 10-pAb oligoclonal antibody cocktail preparations exhibited additive, high-affinity, tumor-specific binding with minimal reactivity to healthy tissues. In vivo, this pAb cocktail significantly suppressed tumor growth and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, prolonged median survival to over 90 days in treated mice compared to less than 25 days in controls. Whole exome sequence data revealed that the majority of human CRC tumors harbored 10 or more MSPs, with minimal overlap between individuals, highlighting the feasibility and necessity of personalized antibody-based therapies.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> Our findings establish a proof-of-concept for individualized, mutation-guided antibody therapies, supporting further development of this approach to improve outcomes in patients with advanced CRC.</div>

                <div class="abs">Necrotic enteritis (NE) and coccidiosis continue to be diagnosed in poultry in Canada. Since 2013, the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) has been collecting data on antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in broiler chicken and turkey flocks, with layer flocks added to surveillance in 2021. This study describes enteric disease control strategies utilized in poultry production from 2018 to 2023, based on farm data reported to CIPARS. In broiler chickens, 85% (51.7 mg/kg broiler chicken biomass) of the total quantity of medically important antimicrobials was used for NE control, compared to 51% (28.1 mg/kg turkey biomass) in turkeys and 74% (16 mg/kg layer biomass) in layers. Since 2019, antimicrobial classes used for NE control have decreased following the voluntary elimination of preventive use of macrolides, penicillins, and streptogramins. Bacitracin remained the most frequently used antimicrobial for NE control across all poultry. For coccidiosis control, ionophores were used more frequently than chemical coccidiostats, with a 2.5:1 ratio in broiler chickens (ionophores: 2892.9 kg; chemical coccidiostats: 1126.6 kg) and a 2.4:1 ratio in turkeys (ionophores: 1840.2 kg; chemical coccidiostats: 749.9 kg). Layer flocks used exclusively monensin (39.3 kg) and amprolium (31.6 kg). Over the surveillance time frame, the diversity of coccidiostats used in broiler chickens and turkeys remained stable. Shuttle/dual-control programs (58%) were commonly used in broiler chickens, whereas continuous/straight programs (51%) were predominant in turkeys. Notably, alternative disease control strategies such as vaccination are emerging or continuing. <br><br>Tendencias en las prácticas de control de la enteritis necrótica y la coccidiosis en las explotaciones avícolas de Canadá, 2018-2023. La enteritis necrótica (EN) y la coccidiosis continúan siendo diagnosticadas en la avicultura de Canadá. Desde 2013, el Programa Integrado Canadiense de Vigilancia de la Resistencia a los Antimicrobianos (CIPARS) recopila datos sobre el uso de antimicrobianos y la resistencia a los mismos en explotaciones de pollos de engorde y pavos, y desde 2021 también incluye a las explotaciones de ponedoras. Este estudio describe las estrategias de control de enfermedades entéricas utilizadas en la producción avícola entre 2018 y 2023, basándose en los datos de las granjas reportados a CIPARS. En pollos de engorde, el 85% (51.7 mg/kg de biomasa) del total de antimicrobianos de importancia médica se utilizó para el control de la enteritis necrótica, frente al 51% (28.1 mg/kg de biomasa) en pavos y el 74% (16 mg/kg de biomasa) en aves de postura. Desde 2019, la utilización de clases de antimicrobianos para el control de la enteritis necrótica ha disminuido tras la eliminación voluntaria del uso preventivo de macrólidos, penicilinas y estreptograminas. La bacitracina se mantuvo como el antimicrobiano más utilizado para el control de la enteritis necrótica en todas las especies. Para el control de la coccidiosis, los ionóforos se utilizaron con mayor frecuencia que los coccidiostáticos químicos, en una proporción de 2.5:1 en pollos de engorde (ionóforos: 2892.9 kg; coccidiostáticos químicos: 1126.6 kg) y de 2.4:1 en pavos (ionóforos: 1840.2 kg; coccidiostáticos químicos: 749.9 kg). Las explotaciones de aves de postura utilizaron exclusivamente monensina (39.3 kg) y amprolio (31.6 kg). Durante el periodo de vigilancia, la diversidad de coccidiostáticos utilizados en pollos de engorde y pavos se mantuvo estable. Los programas de control alterno/dual (58%) se utilizaron comúnmente en pollos de engorde, mientras que los programas continuos/directos (51%) predominaron en pavos.

                <div class="abs">This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and analytical performance of OvaCyte, an automated image-based system for the detection of gastrointestinal parasites in ruminants, against traditional flotation techniques. OvaCyte is available in two versions: OvaCyte Plus, which automates egg detection and quantification, and OvaCyte Premium, which incorporates enhanced analysis to differentiate parasite families, genera, and species within strongyles (e.g., Trichostrongylidae, Haemonchus contortus, and Nematodirus spp.). Coccidia are also classified as standard or type B, with the latter specifically including Eimeria weybridgensis, Eimeria crandallis and Eimeria ovinoidalis, based on distinct morphometrical features. The identification of Haemonchus contortus was validated using peanut agglutinin (PNA) fluorescence staining as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity for OvaCyte Plus, Mini-FLOTAC, and McMaster were calculated based on a consensus "true status". Limits of detection and quantification were calculated using regression analysis. OvaCyte Plus demonstrated the highest sensitivity, especially for Nematodirus (95%), coccidia (93%), strongyles (92%), and Strongyloides papillosus (90%). Mini-FLOTAC showed moderate sensitivity (63-79%), while McMaster had the lowest value (30-76%). For Moniezia spp., sensitivity was similar for OvaCyte Plus and Mini-FLOTAC (79%), but lower for McMaster (59%). Specificity was high across all techniques (92-100%). Differences in performance were attributed to varying multiplication factors: OvaCyte Plus (3 EPG), Mini-FLOTAC (7.5 EPG), and McMaster (50 EPG). Strong correlations were observed between OvaCyte Plus and manual techniques for strongyle egg counts. OvaCyte Premium exhibited the highest sensitivity across all parasites. OvaCyte Plus and Premium demonstrated performance comparable to or exceeding traditional techniques for the detection of gastrointestinal parasites in ruminants.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>TITLE:</b> Évaluation d’OvaCyte pour la détection des parasites gastro-intestinaux chez les ovins et les bovins : comparaison avec les techniques de flottaison traditionnelles.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>ABSTRACT:</b> Cette étude visait à évaluer les performances diagnostiques et analytiques d’OvaCyte, un système automatisé d’imagerie pour la détection des parasites gastro-intestinaux chez les ruminants, par rapport aux techniques de flottaison traditionnelles. OvaCyte est disponible en deux versions : OvaCyte Plus, qui automatise la détection et la quantification des œufs, et OvaCyte Premium, qui intègre une analyse avancée pour la différenciation des espèces et des familles de parasites, notamment parmi les strongles (par exemple Trichostrongylidae, Haemonchus contortus et Nematodirus spp.). Les coccidies sont également classées en deux types : standard et de type B, ce dernier incluant spécifiquement Eimeria weybridgensis, Eimeria crandallis et Eimeria ovinoidalis, selon des caractéristiques morphométriques distinctes. L’identification d’Haemonchus contortus a été validée par coloration fluorescente à l’agglutinine d’arachide (PNA), considérée comme la méthode de référence. La sensibilité et la spécificité des tests OvaCyte Plus, Mini-FLOTAC et McMaster ont été calculées selon un consensus sur le statut réel des parasites. Les limites de détection et de quantification ont été calculées par analyse de régression. OvaCyte Plus a démontré la plus grande sensibilité, notamment pour Nematodirus (95 %), les coccidies (93 %), les strongles (92 %) et Strongyloides papillosus (90 %). Mini-FLOTAC a montré une sensibilité modérée (63–79 %), tandis que McMaster a présenté la plus faible (30–76 %). Pour Moniezia spp., la sensibilité était similaire pour OvaCyte Plus et Mini-FLOTAC (79 %), mais inférieure pour McMaster (59 %). La spécificité était élevée pour toutes les techniques (92–100 %). Les différences de performance ont été attribuées aux différents facteurs de multiplication : OvaCyte Plus (3 œufs par gramme), Mini-FLOTAC (7,5 œufs par gramme) et McMaster (50 œufs par gramme). De fortes corrélations ont été observées entre OvaCyte Plus et les techniques manuelles pour le comptage des œufs de strongles. OvaCyte Premium a présenté la plus grande sensibilité pour tous les parasites. OvaCyte Plus et Premium ont démontré des performances comparables, voire supérieures, aux techniques traditionnelles de détection des parasites gastro-intestinaux chez les ruminants.</div>

                <div class="abs"><b style='color:#3498db;'>OBJECTIVE:</b> Insidiousness is a hallmark of metachronous liver metastasis. Owing to the absence of a comprehensive machine-learning model integrating systemic inflammatory indicators for predicting metachronous liver metastasis after colon cancer surgery, and to the lack of prospective validation and interpretability, this study aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning model for predicting postoperative metachronous liver metastasis in patients with colon cancer.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> The variable pool of risk factors was determined through meta-analysis combined with three distinct screening approaches. The model was developed retrospectively and validated prospectively. The retrospective cohort comprised patients who underwent radical colectomy for colon cancer at X Hospital, S Hospital, and the P Hospital between 1 January 2012 and 1 January 2023. The prospective cohort included patients at X Hospital between 1 March 2023 and 1 August 2024. In the retrospective cohort, patients were randomly allocated to a training set and an internal validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Feature selection was performed using Lasso regression, multivariable logistic regression, and the Boruta random forest algorithm. The performance of ten machine-learning models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score. AUC, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis were employed to elucidate clinical utility. Model interpretability was achieved through SHapley Additive exPlanations.

Following three feature-selection procedures and two multicollinearity assessments, 18 basic clinical variables and nine immune-inflammatory indices were selected for model development. Gradient boosting machine (GBM) demonstrated the highest overall performance, with an AUC of 0.964 (95 % CI: 0.944-0.983); compared with other models, decision-curve analysis revealed superior clinical utility.

                <div class="abs">Mitochondria play a central role in liver physiology by regulating key metabolic processes. Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple liver diseases, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver failure following hepatectomy. Subcellular fractionation is widely used to isolate mitochondria from liver cells or tissue; however, the enrichment and purity of isolated fractions are critical to ensure reliable downstream functional and proteomic analyses. Conventional validation methods, such as immunoblotting of organelle-specific markers, are limited by low throughput, restricted sensitivity, and variability. In this study, we present a targeted proteomics strategy based on parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to quantitatively assess the enrichment of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions obtained from liver samples using commercial isolation kits. PRM analyses demonstrated robust and compartment-specific enrichment in both PLC/PRF/5 cells and mouse liver tissue. In PLC/PRF/5 cells, high nuclear/cytosolic enrichment was observed for Prelamin A/C, while mitochondrial markers such as ATPase showed strong mitochondrial/cytosolic ratios. Cytosolic markers consistently displayed enrichment in the cytosolic fraction. Similar trends were observed in mouse liver tissue, confirming applicability across biological systems. Overall, these results highlight PRM as a sensitive, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative to immunodetection approaches for evaluating subcellular fraction purity, supporting high-quality mitochondrial preparations for translational hepatology studies.</div>

                <div class="abs">We report the case of a 15-year-old previously healthy male who presented with several days of progressive abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia. On arrival to the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable. Patient's abdominal exam revealed a soft, benign abdomen with right-sided greater than left-sided tenderness. Cross-sectional imaging demonstrated sigmoid volvulus without evidence of pneumatosis, perforation, or free air. He underwent multidisciplinary evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology, and urgent endoscopic detorsion was performed. Pediatric sigmoid volvulus is rare, accounting for a small minority of large bowel obstructions in this age group. Symptoms may be nonspecific, and exam findings can appear reassuring despite the presence of a high-risk surgical emergency. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in adolescents presenting with abdominal pain and underscores the role of imaging and multidisciplinary collaboration in timely recognition and management.</div>

                <div class="abs">Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in remission require monitoring, but optimal timing for endoscopic assessment is unknown. We aimed to assess variability in time from remission to surveillance endoscopy and associations with disease outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with EoE who achieved histologic remission (<15 eos/hpf) while on stable treatment and had at least one surveillance endoscopy with biopsy after remission. Time to surveillance was categorized (≤1 year, 1-2 years, >2 years) and compared to a range of EoE clinicopathologic characteristics and disease outcomes. The 91-patient cohort had substantial variability in time to first surveillance endoscopy (mean 1.3 ± 1.0 years; median/IQR 1.0/0.6-1.8; range 0.2-7.3). While most patient characteristics were not associated with time to surveillance, larger dilation size at remission correlated with longer surveillance intervals (R = 0.36, p = 0.03), and EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) was inversely associated (R = -0.21, p = 0.07). Outcomes of EREFS, Index of Severity of EoE, and eosinophil count were similar for <1, 1-2, or 2+ years surveillance intervals. However, numerically fewer patients with endoscopy 2+ years after remission maintained histologic response (59% vs. 78% at ≤1 year and 82% at 1-2 years; p = 0.15) and had more ongoing EoE symptoms (47% vs. 34% at ≤1 year and 24% at 1-2 years; p = 0.26). Surveillance timing in EoE remission varies widely and is largely unexplained by clinical features, except for dilation size. While outcomes were similar across intervals, patients with longer surveillance (>2 years) had numerically less histologic response and more persistent symptoms, warranting further study.</div>

Risk-adjusted outcomes were estimated using multivariable logistic regression with marginal effects, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, biliary diagnosis, admission type, and year. Adjusted estimates for length of stay were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression with marginal effects, adjusting for the same covariates. Data were analyzed between March and August 2025.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:</b> Key outcomes included length of stay, 30-day readmission, complications, serious complications, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality. Specific complications, such as intraoperative hemorrhage, bile duct injury, transfusion, percutaneous drainage, urinary tract infection, and deep venous thrombosis, were also assessed.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Among 516 372 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.8 [9.8] years; 52.4% female), the proportion who had unplanned (vs elective) admissions for cholecystectomy increased from 78.8% in 2011 to 90.1% in 2021 (P < .001), alongside increases in Elixhauser comorbidity burden. Risk-adjusted rates of overall complications decreased from 21.5% (95% CI, 21.3%-21.7%) in 2011 to 16.5% (95% CI, 16.4%-16.7%) in 2021 (P < .001), and serious complications declined from 12.3% (95% CI, 12.2%-12.5%) to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.9%-7.1%) (P < .001). Specific complications also improved, including intraoperative hemorrhage (1.07% [95% CI, 1.01%-1.13%] to 0.54% [95% CI, 0.50%-0.58%]), blood transfusion (5.47% [95% CI, 5.34%-5.60%] to 1.87% [95% CI, 1.80%-1.94%]), and bile duct injury (0.19% [95% CI, 0.16%-0.21%] to 0.12% [95% CI, 0.11%-0.14%]) (all P < .001). However, rates of postoperative percutaneous drainage increased from 1.32% (95% CI, 1.26%-1.37%) to 2.91% (95% CI, 2.81%-3.01%) (P < .001).<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:</b> In this study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing inpatient minimally invasive cholecystectomy, surgical complication rates, including bile duct injury, declined substantially from 2011 to 2021 despite increasing patient complexity. These improvements may reflect improved technique, overcoming the initial learning curve, or the cumulative influence of quality improvement efforts. The increasing use of drainage may reflect evolving surgical practice rather than declining quality, which underscores the need for continued investigation and surveillance.</div>

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has also gained attention as a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy, as it may correlate with treatment outcomes.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>OBJECTIVE:</b> To examine the expression of PD-L1 on TIICs and assess the influence of PD-L1 and NLR on immunotherapy outcomes following biliary tract cancers (BTC) recurrence.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> From January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2020, this study enrolled 239 patients from the Department of Pancreaticobiliary Surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 on TIICs was conducted on pathological tissue sections from these patients. Clinical data, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and pathological findings, were collected during follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed to assess outcomes related to the study objectives. Furthermore, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were utilized to examine PD-L1 expression profiles and related information.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Tumor stage did not differ significantly (P = 0.173), while metastasis stage approached significance (P = 0.093), with a higher proportion of M0 cases in the PD-L1 low group. Univariate analysis revealed vascular tumor thrombus, tumor differentiation, node stage, and preoperative CA199 levels as factors associated with DFS. Notably, vascular tumor thrombus (HR = 1.791, P = 0.002), moderate tumor differentiation (HR = 0.537, P = 0.002), and elevated preoperative CA199 levels (>35, HR = 1.624, P = 0.009) emerged as significant risk factors. Elevated NLR demonstrated a significant association with reduced DFS (HR = 1.54, p = 0.017 one week prior; HR = 1.70, p = 0.007 one month after) and diminished OS (HR = 2.30, p < 0.001 one week prior; HR = 1.94, p = 0.005 one month after). Exploratory analysis in a limited immunotherapy subgroup (n=35) suggested patients exhibiting high PD-L1 levels on TIICs may be associated with worse OS following immunotherapy after recurrence (HR = 3.03, p = 0.036). High NLR, both one month before recurrence (HR = 2.23, p = 0.015) and one month after recurrence (HR = 2.10, p = 0.027), correlated with decreased OS.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> PD-L1 expression on TIICs and dynamic NLR may be indicative of prognosis in BTC and could provide insights into immune status and response to immunotherapy after recurrence.

                <div class="abs">Although circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation has emerged as the mainstream approach in multi-cancer detection blood tests (MCDBTs), the potential of integrating proteins and mutations, to enhance its performance remains unclear. The PROMISE study (NCT04972201) was conducted to investigate the feasibility of a multi-omics integration strategy in MCDBTs across nine types of cancers in head and neck (excluding nasopharynx), esophagus, lung, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, colorectum, and ovary. Blood samples were prospectively collected from 1,706 participants (840 non-cancer; 866 cancer) and then randomly divided into training and validation sets. The complementarity between various omics were investigated, and specific omics features were carefully selected for further multimodal model construction. The methylation-based classifier outperformed both the mutation-based and protein-based classifiers. As 95.0% of cancer cases detected by the mutation-based classifier were simultaneously identified by the methylation-based classifier, while 14.0% of the protein-positive samples were missed, protein markers may provide complementary value to the methylation-based classifier. Compared with the methylation-based classifier, the multimodal classifier combining methylation and protein features exhibited an improved sensitivity of 75.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.3%-80.3%) at the same specificity of 98.8% with the accuracy of top predicted origin (TPO1) of 73.1% (95% CI, 66.2%-79.2%). Notably, the TPO1 accuracy reached 100% in liver and ovarian cancers with negative results of the methylation-based classifier. Collectively, these data suggest that the integration of protein markers in the multimodal classifier can offer additional benefits to the methylation-based classifier, particularly in identifying liver and ovarian cancers.</div>

                <div class="abs">BackgroundSplenic hilar aneurysms exceeding 2 cm in diameter typically warrant surgical intervention given their elevated risk of fatal rupture. While complete splenectomy has historically been the conventional approach to mitigate operative complexity, this procedure carries significant postoperative concerns including compromised immune function and increased thrombotic risks associated with splenic absence.Case presentationIn two cases of splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) deeply embedded within the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilar region, we performed laparoscopic resection of the splenic artery aneurysm and distal pancreas. Intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging was employed to map perfusion patterns of the spleen, demonstrating sequential greening and subsequent fading of the splenic upper pole. This confirmed preserved arterial inflow and venous drainage, thus confirming maintained vascularization following splenic artery ligation. The patients achieved an uneventful recovery and were discharged without complications.ConclusionsWe described the first use of a technique that integrates distal pancreatectomy with ICG-guided partial splenic preservation for complex splenic hilar aneurysms. This strategy facilitates precise resection of the aneurysm and non-viable spleen, thereby maximizing functional preservation and establishing itself as a promising option for managing these challenging lesions.</div>

                <div class="abs">Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant risk factor for several cancers, particularly cancers of the liver, pancreas, and endometrium. This review aims to understand the connections between diabetic pathophysiology and cancer biology. We synthesize how core metabolic disturbances-hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and inflammation-promote tumorigenesis by dysregulating canonical oncogenic pathways such as IGF-1 signaling, DNA damage repair, and immunometabolism. Subsequently, we focus on how key molecular integrators-such as p38 MAPK, Wnt/β-catenin, and the AGEs-RAGE axis-mediate metabolic stress to confer proliferative and invasive advantages to tumor cells. However, a direct translational application of these mechanisms, particularly in the context of repurposing antidiabetic drugs for cancer therapy, remains challenging due to inconsistent clinical outcomes. To address this gap, we suggest that a fundamental shift in approach is required. We propose that future research must move beyond simple pathway categorization and instead utilize spatial analysis techniques to reveal how diabetic metabolites reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME). By integrating single-cell and spatial omics technologies, the field can begin to map the precise cellular niches within tumors where diabetic metabolites exacerbate malignant progression and foster treatment resistance. This perspective is essential for developing targeted strategies to mitigate cancer risk and improve outcomes for the expanding population of patients with DM and cancer.</div>

                <div class="abs">This review highlights the crucial role of olfaction in regulating energy homeostasis. Neurons in the olfactory system stimulate the limbic and hedonic pathways involved in food-related behaviors. These neurons are modulated by the body's energy metabolism status, which they, in turn, help to regulate. Olfactory sensitivity is reduced in obesity, while bariatric surgery restores olfactory function. In type 2 diabetes, the onset of olfactory dysfunction is predictive of cognitive decline. Finally, in a mouse model of obesity, local activation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and its receptors in the olfactory bulb -the main brain structure responsible for encoding odorsleads to improved glycemic control and regulation of food intake. Activation of this new neurometabolic pathway connecting the olfactory system to the pancreas leads to increased insulin secretion and sensitivity to this hormone.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>TITLE:</b> Interrégulations entre olfaction et métabolisme énergétique dans l’obésité et le diabète de type 2 - Des modèles murins aux humains.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>ABSTRACT:</b> Cette synthèse présente le rôle crucial de l’olfaction dans la régulation de l’homéostasie énergétique. Les neurones du système olfactif stimulent les aires cérébrales impliquées dans les émotions, la mémoire et le plaisir, et qui sont liées à l’alimentation. Ils sont modulés par le niveau du métabolisme énergétique corporel, qu’ils régulent en retour. La sensibilité olfactive diminue dans l’obésité et la chirurgie bariatrique la rétablit. Dans le diabète de type 2, l’apparition de troubles olfactifs peut prédire les troubles cognitifs. Enfin, dans un modèle murin de l’obésité, l’activation locale du système glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) dans le bulbe olfactif, première structure cérébrale codant les odeurs, induit une meilleure régulation de la glycémie et de la prise alimentaire. Le recrutement de cette nouvelle voie neurométabolique menant jusqu’au pancréas provoque une augmentation de la libération d’insuline et de la sensibilité à cette hormone.</div>

                <div class="abs">Paligenosis is an emerging model of mature cell plasticity that enables terminally differentiated cells to re-enter the cell cycle and contribute to tissue regeneration following injury. This tightly regulated process involves an initial phase of autophagy-mediated organelle clearance coupled with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) suppression, followed by mTORC1 reactivation and stemness gene induction that establishes regenerative competence, ultimately culminating in proliferation and lineage restoration. While paligenosis provides an adaptive mechanism to rapidly replenish lost cells in tissues such as the stomach and pancreas, persistent activation under chronic stress or oncogenic signals may drive metaplasia and tumor initiation. Recent evidence further implicates paligenosis-like programs in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance, underscoring its dual roles in regeneration and disease. Ongoing investigation into the molecular circuitry of paligenosis-including metabolic rewiring, canonical signaling, and epigenetic remodeling-may yield new insights into both tissue repair and oncogenic transformation, offering novel opportunities for therapeutic targeting.</div>
