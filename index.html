These recommendations are intended to guide the structure of training programs, ensure safe dissemination of POEM, and support the evolution of competency-based education in third-space endoscopy.</div></div> <b style='color:#3498db;'>BACKGROUND AND AIMS:</b> Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a complex, technically demanding endoscopic procedure that requires focused, structured training. While increasingly adopted in both gastroenterology and surgical practice, there has been no consensus-based guidance to establish adequate training standards in POEM. Using a validated consensus methodology, we aimed to define minimum standards for POEM training programs to ensure competence in technical, cognitive, and integrative skills necessary for safe and effective practice.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The Research and Development (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness method (RAM) was used to evaluate candidate statements across 5 domains: pretraining activities, structure of training programs, POEM-specific cognitive training, POEM-specific technical training, and assessment of competence. Experts participated in 2 rounds of voting, rating each statement on a 9-point scale from highly inappropriate (1) to highly appropriate (9). For each statement, the median score and mean absolute deviation from the median were calculated. A statement was considered appropriate if it received a median score ≥7 and met the criteria for appropriateness based on the BIOMED, Interpercentile Range Adjusted for Symmetry, and P value methods.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Of the 40 proposed statements, 34 met the criteria as appropriate. Key recommendations included that trainees should undergo POEM training within programs performing at least 40 procedures annually, be mentored by at least 1 trainer with ≥100 prior POEMs, and complete a minimum of 15 POEMs before undergoing milestone assessments with a validated assessment tool. Cognitive requirements included mastery of mediastinal anatomy, GERD management, electrosurgical tools, and interpretation of motility and imaging studies. Simulation model training and exposure to esophageal POEM, gastric POEM, and Zenker POEM were also recommended.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSIONS:</b> This consensus effort provides evidence-based minimum standards for POEM training, applicable to both GI and surgical trainees. These recommendations are intended to guide the structure of training programs, ensure safe dissemination of POEM, and support the evolution of competency-based education in third-space endoscopy.<br><br>

                </div>
            </summary>
            <div style="padding:20px; background:#f8f9fa; border-top:1px solid #eee; font-size:0.95em; color:#555; line-height:1.7;">
                 Enumeration of lines of therapy (LoT) is critical across oncology for ensuring optimal patient care, establishing uniform eligibility for clinical trial enrolment, standardising use of real-world data (RWD), and pooling data for research purposes. Building on an earlier proposal for assigning LoT in oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) developed the ESMO adaptation of Lines of Systemic Therapy (EnLiST) framework applicable to solid tumours across the full range of common clinical settings. A Delphi process was adopted to reach a consensus between expert representatives of multiple stakeholder perspectives including medical oncologists, clinical trialists, regulators, academics, patient advocates, experts from the pharmaceutical industry and clinical research organisations, artificial intelligence professionals, funding body specialists and ethicists. EnLiST provides a set of standard definitions, the format of reporting LoT, the minimum required data to be recorded, and guidelines for assigning LoT. In EnLiST, a LoT is separately assigned to systemic anticancer therapies (SACT) in the early (eLoT), advanced (aLoT) and investigational (iLoT) settings; each expressed as two numerals separated by a decimal point (e.g., 1.0). A change in SACT results in either a "New" LoT, a "Modified" LoT, or the "Same" LoT. A New LoT results from clinical progression of disease (cPD) or lack of adequate tumour response, and is recorded as the next sequential value to the left of the decimal point (e.g., following LoT 1.0, the New LoT will be LoT 2.0). If the change in treatment is for other reasons (e.g., intolerability), a Modified LoT is recorded and assigned the next sequential value to the right of the decimal point (e.g., following LoT 1.0, the Modified LoT will be LoT 1.1). EnLiST has been designed to serve the needs of a wide range of stakeholders while enhancing the quality of clinical care, clinical research and RWD.<br><br>

                </div>
            </summary>
            <div style="padding:20px; background:#f8f9fa; border-top:1px solid #eee; font-size:0.95em; color:#555; line-height:1.7;">
                 <b style='color:#3498db;'>DESCRIPTION:</b> This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) expert review will advise clinicians on the diagnosis and management of gastric mucosal polyps. Gastric polyps are raised epithelial lesions of the gastric mucosa that can arise from various mucosal alterations and perturbations, including mucosal hyperplasia, adenoma, fundic gland proliferation, and enterochromaffin-like cell proliferation. Current guidance on the management of gastric polyps remains limited. This CPU provides a framework for understanding the natural history and epidemiology of gastric polyps and advises on best practices for the endoscopic detection and classification of gastric polyps, the endoscopic resection of gastric polyps, and endoscopic surveillance following resection. Because gastric polyps often occur within a field of altered gastric mucosa (eg, mucosal atrophy, pseudo-pyloric and intestinal metaplasia), we will advise on best practices for the sampling and surveillance of mucosal pathology giving rise to gastric polyps. This CPU is intended to complement other documents issued by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute on gastric neoplastic and pre-neoplastic lesions, including the clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia, as well as AGA CPUs on atrophic gastritis, high-quality upper endoscopy, and screening and surveillance of individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE STATEMENTS BPA 1: Gastric polyps are frequently identified during upper endoscopy exams and include different histologic subtypes, such as fundic gland polyps (FGPs), gastric hyperplastic polyps (GHPs), hamartomatous polyps, gastric adenomas (GAs), pyloric gland adenomas, oxyntic gland adenomas, and gastric neuroendocrine tumors (G-NETs). BPA 2: Clinicians should be aware that different types of gastric polyps may coexist in the same person. BPA 3: Clinicians should be aware that different types of gastric polyps are associated with varying spectra of histopathologic abnormalities in the surrounding gastric mucosa, which may aid in their identification and diagnosis. BPA 4: Systematic endoscopic examination of the polyps and the surrounding gastric mucosa is essential in assessing the underlying gastric mucosa pathology (eg, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia [GIM]) and determining subsequent management: biopsies of the polyps, biopsies of the surrounding mucosa, and resection of the polyps. BPA 5: All patients with adenomatous or hyperplastic gastric polyps should be tested and treated if positive for H pylori infection. BPA 6: Patients who are using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for valid reasons do not need to discontinue these medications in the presence of documented fundic gland hyperplasia-related gastric polyps. BPA 7: Clinicians should be aware that different histological types of gastric polyps have unique/characteristic topographical features, endoscopic features, and size. BPA 8: Endoscopic evaluation of patients with gastric polyps should include complete inspection with high-definition white-light and enhanced imaging, such as virtual chromoendoscopy. Endoscopists should recognize and photo-document the endoscopic features of gastric polyps as well as the surrounding gastric mucosal abnormalities. BPA 9: Clinicians should be aware that endoscopic resection of the polyps includes traditional techniques (snare and biopsy forceps, mucosal resection) or endoscopic submucosal dissection. BPA 10: In the presence of numerous gastric polyps of varied sizes, the largest polyps should be resected when possible, and the smaller polyps sampled or resected. BPA 11: Suspected abnormalities in the surrounding mucosa, such as GIM or atrophic gastritis, should undergo targeted biopsies according to the existing protocols. BPA 12: Surveillance plans in patients with gastric polyps should be formulated based on the histopathological type of the polyps and the surrounding gastric mucosa. BPA 13: When a dysplastic lesion in the polyp is confirmed and resected completely, a follow-up surveillance endoscopy should be completed in 1 year for patients with low-grade dysplasia polyps and 6 months for patients with high-grade dysplasia polyps. If the polyp is biopsied or resection is incomplete, follow-up endoscopy is advised within 3 months for high-grade dysplasia and 6 months for low-grade dysplasia. BPA 14: Endoscopic surveillance is advised in patients with gastric polyps when the histopathology of adjacent mucosa confirms GIM and/or atrophic gastritis.<br><br>

                 This international, multidisciplinary consensus report represents the first effort to systematically define and characterize fatty pancreas. A key outcome of this endeavor was the recommendation to adopt "fatty pancreas" as the standardized and inclusive term to describe all forms of fat accumulation in the pancreas. This terminological consensus provides a critical foundation for unified reporting and clinical communication. Another major contribution of the report is the consensus on diagnostic imaging findings, which was based on radiological and endoscopic modalities. The proposed criteria aim to enhance consistency in clinical assessment and support the development of standardized research protocols. In addition to establishing terminology and diagnostic frameworks, the report also synthesizes current knowledge across a wide range of relevant domains. These include the etiology and epidemiology of fatty pancreas, as well as its associations with alcohol consumption, smoking, acute and chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and surgical outcomes. The potential links between fatty pancreas and neoplastic conditions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and pancreatic cancer are also addressed, alongside the current understanding of its metabolic implications (beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis) and treatment strategies. Throughout the consensus process, a consistent theme emerged: the limited availability of high-quality, prospective clinical data. Therefore, many of the recommendations in this report are based on expert consensus rather than strong empirical evidence. As such, the statements require rigorous prospective validation before they can be adopted into routine clinical practice. This underscores a critical need for further research, particularly studies aimed at clarifying causal relationships, validating diagnostic tools, and determining the clinical relevance of fatty pancreas across diverse patient populations. This report serves as both a summary of our current understanding and a roadmap for future investigations, aiming to close existing knowledge gaps and guide evidence-based clinical practice in this emerging field.<br><br>

Pelvic floor physical therapy is a critical part of multidisciplinary management for these conditions, yet there is little guidance or standardization to guide providers' referral practices, diagnostic approaches, or treatment.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>OBJECTIVE:</b> To develop multidisciplinary consensus-based recommendations for incorporating pelvic floor physical therapy into the treatment of obstructed defecation syndrome and posterior compartment prolapse.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>DATA SOURCES:</b> MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for English-language studies on pelvic floor physical therapy, obstructed defecation, diagnostic criteria, imaging, and pelvic organ prolapse.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>STUDY SELECTION:</b> Studies identified in the literature search were reviewed by multidisciplinary expert subgroups, who formulated draft statements based on the available evidence.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>INTERVENTION:</b> Consensus meetings were conducted and included experts from colorectal surgery, urogynecology, physical therapy, gastroenterology, radiology, and urology. Statements were evaluated via structured discussions and voting processes. Those reaching more than 70% consensus were adopted for inclusion. Statements underwent final review and editing by the leadership of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the International Urogynecological Association.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:</b> Consensus statements addressed referral criteria, diagnostic evaluations, therapy protocols, timing, coordination with surgery, and management of anatomical abnormalities.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Fifteen statements reached consensus. Key recommendations included prompt referral to pelvic floor physical therapy for patients without contraindications, individualized therapy based on appropriate diagnostic evaluation and patient goals, timing of pelvic floor physical therapy relative to surgery, and trauma-informed patient care.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>LIMITATIONS:</b> Recommendations primarily reflect expert consensus due to limited high-quality evidence. Variability in practitioner expertise and geographic access to trained therapists are barriers to consistent implementation.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSIONS:</b> These recommendations provide structured guidance for integrating pelvic floor physical therapy into the management of obstructed defecation syndrome and rectal prolapse. Additional research and standardized training are essential to optimize patient outcomes.<br><br>

Regional variations in gastrointestinal bleeding incidence, infection epidemiology, formulary access, and the relative value placed on bleeding versus infection outcomes by patients and clinicians necessitate contextualized recommendations. This guideline provides regionally adapted, evidence-based recommendations for the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Nordic countries using the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT methodology.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> A multidisciplinary panel from both regions prioritized PICO questions and ranked outcomes by patient importance. The 2024 Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guideline served as the source guideline and was evaluated for credibility; contextual fit in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Nordic countries; and alignment with the GRADE methodology. Evidence profiles and Evidence-to-Decision frameworks were adapted or developed, incorporating updated data, local epidemiology, drug access, and health system variables such as equity, cost, and feasibility.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> The panel adopted the following five recommendations. In critically ill adults with coagulopathy, shock, or chronic liver disease, the panel suggests using SUP over no SUP (conditional recommendation; moderate certainty). In enterally fed patients at high risk of UGIB, the panel suggests using SUP over no SUP (conditional recommendation; very low certainty); in those at low risk, the panel suggests not using SUP (conditional recommendation; very low certainty). For patients receiving SUP, the panel suggests using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) rather than sucralfate (conditional recommendation; low to moderate certainty) and suggests enteral or intravenous administration based on clinical feasibility (conditional recommendation; very low to low certainty). In critically ill adults receiving SUP, low-dose PPI or H2RA therapy should be used rather than high-dose regimens (best practice statement; not GRADEd). Regarding SUP discontinuation, the panel suggests discontinuing SUP in critically ill adults with resolved risk factors for UGIB (conditional recommendations; very low certainty) and in critically ill adults without UGIB risk factors but receiving SUP prior to intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the absence of an active indication (conditional recommendations; very low certainty). Differences in drug availability, ICU discharge practices, and health equity considerations shaped the panel's judgments and highlighted key implementation challenges.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> This guideline offers five context-specific, evidence-informed recommendations for SUP in critically ill adults in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the Nordic countries. While grounded in the health system realities of these regions, the recommendations may inform practice in other settings with similar ICU structures and resource contexts. The panel also identified key research priorities to address remaining evidence gaps and support future updates.<br><br>

                 Patients often need to interrupt anticoagulation for invasive procedures or surgery. Periprocedural bleeding can contribute to substantial morbidity and mortality. Procedural bleed risk stratification informs whether anticoagulation needs to be interrupted, for how long, and when to restart anticoagulation post-procedure. Guidance on procedure-specific bleed risk varies and contributes to discordant perioperative anticoagulation management. To address this important knowledge gap, the Perioperative and Critical Care Thrombosis and Hemostasis Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis undertook a review of contemporary procedural bleed risk stratification schemas and developed a practical bleed risk stratification approach for use in anticoagulated adult patients having a planned elective surgery or procedure.<br><br>

                 The present Part 2 of the updated German S3 guideline on the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris provides recommendations for therapy selection in special clinical situations and in the presence of comorbidities. A major focus of this update is the chapter on screening for tuberculosis as well as therapy selection and management in latent tuberculosis. The recommendations regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays and the indication for chest radiography have been extensively revised. In addition, the guidance on the suitability of systemic psoriasis therapies in patients with latent tuberculosis and on the need for preventive antituberculous treatment has been thoroughly updated. In the chapter on inflammatory bowel diseases, risankizumab and guselkumab have been added as recommended treatment options, as both agents have recently been approved for the indications Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further substantial revisions are included in the chapters on patients with a history of malignancy and viral hepatitis.<br><br>

                 The prognostic value of lymph node (LN) yield in esophageal and gastric cancer remains controversial, especially in the context of modern perioperative treatment. This multicenter Danish cohort study evaluates the association between LN yield and survival outcomes. This study included 3092 patients who underwent curative-intent resection for esophageal (n = 2402) or gastric cancer (n = 690) between 2013 and 2021 at four Danish upper GI centers. All cases were registered in the Danish Esophagogastric Cancer Group database, covering 99% of all Danish esophageal and gastric cancer cases. Patients were stratified by nodal status (pN0/pN+) and categorized into five LN yield groups. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. In node-negative esophageal cancer, higher LN yields (20-29, 30-39, and 40+) were significantly associated with improved survival (hazard ratio: 0.47-0.58, P < 0.001) compared with the reference group (16-19). No survival benefit was seen beyond 16-19 nodes in node-positive esophageal or gastric cancers. Perioperative chemotherapy improved survival in node-positive esophageal cancer but had no effect in node-negative esophageal and gastric cancer. Discrepancies between clinical and pathological nodal staging were frequent and influenced both survival estimates and treatment allocation. LN removal was associated with survival in esophageal and gastric cancer. Node-negative patients showed increased survival if ≥20 nodes were removed, while node-positive esophageal cancer and gastric cancer patients showed no difference in survival beyond 16-19. Lastly, discrepancies between clinical and pathological staging underscore the need for more accurate preoperative diagnostics and highlight the impact of modern perioperative chemotherapy.<br><br>

                 Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in remission require monitoring, but optimal timing for endoscopic assessment is unknown. We aimed to assess variability in time from remission to surveillance endoscopy and associations with disease outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with EoE who achieved histologic remission (<15 eos/hpf) while on stable treatment and had at least one surveillance endoscopy with biopsy after remission. Time to surveillance was categorized (≤1 year, 1-2 years, >2 years) and compared to a range of EoE clinicopathologic characteristics and disease outcomes. The 91-patient cohort had substantial variability in time to first surveillance endoscopy (mean 1.3 ± 1.0 years; median/IQR 1.0/0.6-1.8; range 0.2-7.3). While most patient characteristics were not associated with time to surveillance, larger dilation size at remission correlated with longer surveillance intervals (R = 0.36, p = 0.03), and EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) was inversely associated (R = -0.21, p = 0.07). Outcomes of EREFS, Index of Severity of EoE, and eosinophil count were similar for <1, 1-2, or 2+ years surveillance intervals. However, numerically fewer patients with endoscopy 2+ years after remission maintained histologic response (59% vs. 78% at ≤1 year and 82% at 1-2 years; p = 0.15) and had more ongoing EoE symptoms (47% vs. 34% at ≤1 year and 24% at 1-2 years; p = 0.26). Surveillance timing in EoE remission varies widely and is largely unexplained by clinical features, except for dilation size. While outcomes were similar across intervals, patients with longer surveillance (>2 years) had numerically less histologic response and more persistent symptoms, warranting further study.<br><br>

Tumor heterogeneity, driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations, undermines the efficacy of conventional therapies and limits the long-term success of targeted agents. There is an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that can exploit, rather than be constrained by, this heterogeneity.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> We developed a personalized immunotherapeutic pipeline in the syngeneic CT26 murine model of CRC. Briefly, whole exome sequencing identified mutated surface proteins (MSPs) unique to these cells. Of these MSPs, we selected 10 for the generation of MSP-specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). These pAbs were tested for specificity and peptide binding to peptides via ELISA, tumor tissue by immunofluorescence, and tumor cells by flow cytometry. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo using CT26 tumor-bearing mice treated with the pAb cocktail alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. To assess clinical relevance, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole exome sequencing data from 100 human CRC patients for MSP prevalence and inter-patient variability.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> The 10-pAb oligoclonal antibody cocktail preparations exhibited additive, high-affinity, tumor-specific binding with minimal reactivity to healthy tissues. In vivo, this pAb cocktail significantly suppressed tumor growth and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, prolonged median survival to over 90 days in treated mice compared to less than 25 days in controls. Whole exome sequence data revealed that the majority of human CRC tumors harbored 10 or more MSPs, with minimal overlap between individuals, highlighting the feasibility and necessity of personalized antibody-based therapies.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> Our findings establish a proof-of-concept for individualized, mutation-guided antibody therapies, supporting further development of this approach to improve outcomes in patients with advanced CRC.<br><br>

                 Mitochondria play a central role in liver physiology by regulating key metabolic processes. Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple liver diseases, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, and liver failure following hepatectomy. Subcellular fractionation is widely used to isolate mitochondria from liver cells or tissue; however, the enrichment and purity of isolated fractions are critical to ensure reliable downstream functional and proteomic analyses. Conventional validation methods, such as immunoblotting of organelle-specific markers, are limited by low throughput, restricted sensitivity, and variability. In this study, we present a targeted proteomics strategy based on parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to quantitatively assess the enrichment of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions obtained from liver samples using commercial isolation kits. PRM analyses demonstrated robust and compartment-specific enrichment in both PLC/PRF/5 cells and mouse liver tissue. In PLC/PRF/5 cells, high nuclear/cytosolic enrichment was observed for Prelamin A/C, while mitochondrial markers such as ATPase showed strong mitochondrial/cytosolic ratios. Cytosolic markers consistently displayed enrichment in the cytosolic fraction. Similar trends were observed in mouse liver tissue, confirming applicability across biological systems. Overall, these results highlight PRM as a sensitive, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative to immunodetection approaches for evaluating subcellular fraction purity, supporting high-quality mitochondrial preparations for translational hepatology studies.<br><br>

                 We report the case of a 15-year-old previously healthy male who presented with several days of progressive abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia. On arrival to the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable. Patient's abdominal exam revealed a soft, benign abdomen with right-sided greater than left-sided tenderness. Cross-sectional imaging demonstrated sigmoid volvulus without evidence of pneumatosis, perforation, or free air. He underwent multidisciplinary evaluation by pediatric surgery and gastroenterology, and urgent endoscopic detorsion was performed. Pediatric sigmoid volvulus is rare, accounting for a small minority of large bowel obstructions in this age group. Symptoms may be nonspecific, and exam findings can appear reassuring despite the presence of a high-risk surgical emergency. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis in adolescents presenting with abdominal pain and underscores the role of imaging and multidisciplinary collaboration in timely recognition and management.<br><br>

                 Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in remission require monitoring, but optimal timing for endoscopic assessment is unknown. We aimed to assess variability in time from remission to surveillance endoscopy and associations with disease outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included patients with EoE who achieved histologic remission (<15 eos/hpf) while on stable treatment and had at least one surveillance endoscopy with biopsy after remission. Time to surveillance was categorized (≤1 year, 1-2 years, >2 years) and compared to a range of EoE clinicopathologic characteristics and disease outcomes. The 91-patient cohort had substantial variability in time to first surveillance endoscopy (mean 1.3 ± 1.0 years; median/IQR 1.0/0.6-1.8; range 0.2-7.3). While most patient characteristics were not associated with time to surveillance, larger dilation size at remission correlated with longer surveillance intervals (R = 0.36, p = 0.03), and EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) was inversely associated (R = -0.21, p = 0.07). Outcomes of EREFS, Index of Severity of EoE, and eosinophil count were similar for <1, 1-2, or 2+ years surveillance intervals. However, numerically fewer patients with endoscopy 2+ years after remission maintained histologic response (59% vs. 78% at ≤1 year and 82% at 1-2 years; p = 0.15) and had more ongoing EoE symptoms (47% vs. 34% at ≤1 year and 24% at 1-2 years; p = 0.26). Surveillance timing in EoE remission varies widely and is largely unexplained by clinical features, except for dilation size. While outcomes were similar across intervals, patients with longer surveillance (>2 years) had numerically less histologic response and more persistent symptoms, warranting further study.<br><br>

This study directly compared these probes for predicting rectal histoendoscopic activity.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> Adults with UC prospectively underwent transabdominal ultrasound (TAS) with TPUS using linear followed by microconvex probes by blinded operators. Rectal total wall thickness (TWT), vascularity (Modified Limberg score [MLS]), and Milan ultrasound criteria (MUC) were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined area under the curve (AUC) for endoscopic (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity >1) and histologic (Nancy Index >1) activity, with paired AUC comparisons.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Ninety-seven patients (32% female; age 18-70 years) were included. For endoscopic activity, TPUS outperformed TAS. Microconvex TPUS showed numerically higher AUCs for selected parameters (TWT: 0.77; vascularity: 0.78; MUC: 0.81) compared with linear TPUS (TWT: 0.75; vascularity: 0.71; MUC: 0.77), although head-to-head differences were not consistently statistically significant. For histologic activity, microconvex and linear TPUS demonstrated comparable performance (AUC range 0.66-0.80). Axial-plane posterior wall thickness assessment with the microconvex probe showed favorable trends over longitudinal measurements (endoscopic: ΔAUC -0.071, P = .074; histologic: ΔAUC 0.081, P = .08). Vascularity-based metrics were consistently superior on TPUS compared with TAS, irrespective of probe type.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> TPUS provides clinically relevant, noninvasive assessment of rectal inflammation in UC. While microconvex TPUS offers technical advantages-particularly axial-plane assessment of posterior wall thickness with favorable diagnostic trends-no single probe demonstrated uniform superiority.

Despite its established efficacy, a substantial proportion of patients develop subtherapeutic IFX trough concentrations (< 3 μg/mL), leading to diminished clinical response and treatment failure.

Comprehensive demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were retrieved from electronic records. Variable selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), after which a multivariable logistic model was developed. Model discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness were assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves (CIC).<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Of the 347 participants, 148 (42.7%) exhibited subtherapeutic IFX trough concentrations. LASSO and multivariable logistic analyses identified four independent predictors: older age at diagnosis (> 40 years), elevated anti-drug antibody levels, higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate and reduced albumin (P < 0.05). The model demonstrated an AUC of 0.737 (95% CI 0.684-0.790), with a bootstrap-adjusted AUC of 0.726 (95% CI 0.697-0.739) based on 1000 resamples.

                 <b style='color:#3498db;'>IMPORTANCE:</b> Cholecystectomy is among the most common surgical procedures in the US, yet as patient complexity has increased and surgical techniques have evolved, contemporary trends in complication rates remain understudied.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>OBJECTIVE:</b> To evaluate changes in postoperative outcomes and complication rates following minimally invasive cholecystectomy among Medicare beneficiaries between 2011 and 2021.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:</b> This cohort study used Medicare fee-for-service claims data from 2011 to 2021 to identify beneficiaries undergoing inpatient minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) cholecystectomy. Risk-adjusted outcomes were estimated using multivariable logistic regression with marginal effects, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, biliary diagnosis, admission type, and year. Adjusted estimates for length of stay were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression with marginal effects, adjusting for the same covariates. Data were analyzed between March and August 2025.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:</b> Key outcomes included length of stay, 30-day readmission, complications, serious complications, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality. Specific complications, such as intraoperative hemorrhage, bile duct injury, transfusion, percutaneous drainage, urinary tract infection, and deep venous thrombosis, were also assessed.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Among 516 372 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 74.8 [9.8] years; 52.4% female), the proportion who had unplanned (vs elective) admissions for cholecystectomy increased from 78.8% in 2011 to 90.1% in 2021 (P < .001), alongside increases in Elixhauser comorbidity burden. Risk-adjusted rates of overall complications decreased from 21.5% (95% CI, 21.3%-21.7%) in 2011 to 16.5% (95% CI, 16.4%-16.7%) in 2021 (P < .001), and serious complications declined from 12.3% (95% CI, 12.2%-12.5%) to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.9%-7.1%) (P < .001). Specific complications also improved, including intraoperative hemorrhage (1.07% [95% CI, 1.01%-1.13%] to 0.54% [95% CI, 0.50%-0.58%]), blood transfusion (5.47% [95% CI, 5.34%-5.60%] to 1.87% [95% CI, 1.80%-1.94%]), and bile duct injury (0.19% [95% CI, 0.16%-0.21%] to 0.12% [95% CI, 0.11%-0.14%]) (all P < .001). However, rates of postoperative percutaneous drainage increased from 1.32% (95% CI, 1.26%-1.37%) to 2.91% (95% CI, 2.81%-3.01%) (P < .001).<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:</b> In this study of Medicare beneficiaries undergoing inpatient minimally invasive cholecystectomy, surgical complication rates, including bile duct injury, declined substantially from 2011 to 2021 despite increasing patient complexity. These improvements may reflect improved technique, overcoming the initial learning curve, or the cumulative influence of quality improvement efforts. The increasing use of drainage may reflect evolving surgical practice rather than declining quality, which underscores the need for continued investigation and surveillance.<br><br>

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has also gained attention as a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy, as it may correlate with treatment outcomes.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>OBJECTIVE:</b> To examine the expression of PD-L1 on TIICs and assess the influence of PD-L1 and NLR on immunotherapy outcomes following biliary tract cancers (BTC) recurrence.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>METHODS:</b> From January 1, 2017, to January 1, 2020, this study enrolled 239 patients from the Department of Pancreaticobiliary Surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 on TIICs was conducted on pathological tissue sections from these patients. Clinical data, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and pathological findings, were collected during follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed to assess outcomes related to the study objectives. Furthermore, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were utilized to examine PD-L1 expression profiles and related information.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>RESULTS:</b> Tumor stage did not differ significantly (P = 0.173), while metastasis stage approached significance (P = 0.093), with a higher proportion of M0 cases in the PD-L1 low group. Univariate analysis revealed vascular tumor thrombus, tumor differentiation, node stage, and preoperative CA199 levels as factors associated with DFS. Notably, vascular tumor thrombus (HR = 1.791, P = 0.002), moderate tumor differentiation (HR = 0.537, P = 0.002), and elevated preoperative CA199 levels (>35, HR = 1.624, P = 0.009) emerged as significant risk factors. Elevated NLR demonstrated a significant association with reduced DFS (HR = 1.54, p = 0.017 one week prior; HR = 1.70, p = 0.007 one month after) and diminished OS (HR = 2.30, p < 0.001 one week prior; HR = 1.94, p = 0.005 one month after). Exploratory analysis in a limited immunotherapy subgroup (n=35) suggested patients exhibiting high PD-L1 levels on TIICs may be associated with worse OS following immunotherapy after recurrence (HR = 3.03, p = 0.036). High NLR, both one month before recurrence (HR = 2.23, p = 0.015) and one month after recurrence (HR = 2.10, p = 0.027), correlated with decreased OS.<br><br><b style='color:#3498db;'>CONCLUSION:</b> PD-L1 expression on TIICs and dynamic NLR may be indicative of prognosis in BTC and could provide insights into immune status and response to immunotherapy after recurrence. These findings highlight the potential value of integrating local immune contexture with systemic inflammatory markers, but further validation in larger and prospective cohorts is warranted.<br><br>

                 Although circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation has emerged as the mainstream approach in multi-cancer detection blood tests (MCDBTs), the potential of integrating proteins and mutations, to enhance its performance remains unclear. The PROMISE study (NCT04972201) was conducted to investigate the feasibility of a multi-omics integration strategy in MCDBTs across nine types of cancers in head and neck (excluding nasopharynx), esophagus, lung, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, colorectum, and ovary. Blood samples were prospectively collected from 1,706 participants (840 non-cancer; 866 cancer) and then randomly divided into training and validation sets. The complementarity between various omics were investigated, and specific omics features were carefully selected for further multimodal model construction. The methylation-based classifier outperformed both the mutation-based and protein-based classifiers. As 95.0% of cancer cases detected by the mutation-based classifier were simultaneously identified by the methylation-based classifier, while 14.0% of the protein-positive samples were missed, protein markers may provide complementary value to the methylation-based classifier. Compared with the methylation-based classifier, the multimodal classifier combining methylation and protein features exhibited an improved sensitivity of 75.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.3%-80.3%) at the same specificity of 98.8% with the accuracy of top predicted origin (TPO1) of 73.1% (95% CI, 66.2%-79.2%). Notably, the TPO1 accuracy reached 100% in liver and ovarian cancers with negative results of the methylation-based classifier. Collectively, these data suggest that the integration of protein markers in the multimodal classifier can offer additional benefits to the methylation-based classifier, particularly in identifying liver and ovarian cancers.<br><br>

                 Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a high-incidence chronic autoimmune disease, with patients requiring lifelong insulin therapy. In the most severe cases, pancreas transplantation (PTA) arises as the first choice of treatment for these patients in the hope of achieving insulin independence. However, the long-term success of PTA is hindered by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and immune rejection, both of which limit graft survival. To address these challenges, we have developed multifunctional theranostic nanoparticles (t-PLGA NPs) co-encapsulating Fe<br><br>
