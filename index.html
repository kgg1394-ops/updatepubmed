            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pivotal cytokine driving intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The development of monoclonal antibodies selectively targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, including risankizumab, mirikizumab and guselkumab, has significantly expanded the therapeutic landscape of IBD. Landmark phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have demonstrated high efficacy and durable responses, followed by recent regulatory approvals across both indications. Notably, the SEQUENCE trial established the superiority of risankizumab over ustekinumab in achieving endoscopic and clinical endpoints in CD, underscoring the therapeutic value of IL-23p19 blockade and its differentiation from prior p40 inhibition. With additional agents in advanced development, IL-23p19 inhibitors are now emerging as a bona fide treatment class in IBD. Furthermore, IL-23p19 inhibitors display favorable safety profiles and convenient subcutaneous administration regimens, which broaden their applicability across diverse patient populations. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal treatment positioning, comparative effectiveness, and long-term disease outcomes. Precision medicine approaches will be crucial to fully exploit the potential of this drug class. For instance, early biomarkers can help monitor response, while future integration of serological and multi-omics biomarkers may enable the prediction of treatment success and guide personalized selection. This review summarizes the current knowledge base regarding IL-23p19 inhibitors in IBD, highlights their class effects and unique clinical value, and outlines a research agenda towards biomarker-driven and precision-guided use. Ultimately, IL-23p19-inhibition exemplifies how targeted immunotherapy and precision medicine can converge in order to reshape IBD management.</div>

            <div class="abs">The survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains unproven, whereas total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) incorporating preoperative chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcomes. However, the total chemotherapy duration delivered across neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases varies substantially in clinical practice. We investigated the impact of total chemotherapy duration in the STELLAR trial.<br><br>This post hoc analysis was based on the phase III randomized trial, comparing short-course radiotherapy followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (TNT) with long-course chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LARC patients. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with available chemotherapy duration data were included, with a median follow-up of 68.1 months. Patients were categorized: group 1 (no chemotherapy, n = 121), group 2 (3 to 12 weeks, n = 113), group 3 (15 weeks, n = 30), and group 4 (≥ 18 weeks, n = 275). Disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis (DM), and locoregional recurrence (LRR) were assessed using time-dependent Cox regression.<br><br>Group 4 achieved the highest 5-year OS (82.1%) and DFS (66.0%) rates. Compared with groups 1 and 2, group 4 demonstrated significantly improved OS (adj. P ≤ 0.001) and improved DFS versus group 1 (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.443-0.870, adj. P = 0.017). In the TNT cohort, group 4 was associated with significantly improved OS and DFS compared with group 2 (adj. P < 0.01), but not with group 3. Additionally, group 4 showed a significantly lower risk of LRR than group 3. In the CRT cohort, group 4 was associated with improved OS compared with group 1 (adj. P = 0.005); however, this association was not retained in surgical patients. No significant differences in DFS, DM, or LRR were observed across groups in the CRT cohort.<br><br>In TNT cohort, minimum 18 weeks of chemotherapy was associated with improved OS and DFS compared to 3 to 12 weeks. The observed OS benefit of minimum 18 weeks versus no chemotherapy in the CRT cohort was not retained among surgical patients. These findings suggest caution in shortening chemotherapy duration, particularly in high-risk patients treated with TNT, and warrant confirmation in prospective TNT-specific trials.<br><br>The STELLAR trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02533271); however, this post hoc analysis was retrospectively conducted.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is characterized by age-related somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/Ps) and is correlated with an increased risk of myeloid malignancies, elevated inflammatory pathways in circulating myeloid cells, higher all-cause mortality, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is intrinsically linked to heightened inflammation. Nevertheless, the presence of CHIP in IBD and its role in the pathophysiology of IBD remains poorly elucidated. In the UK Biobank, CHIP was associated with an increased incidence of IBD. Females with CHIP had a 1.33-fold higher risk, which was further validated in All of Us data base (ßOR = 1.29). For Crohn's disease, DNMT3A mutations conferred a 1.81-fold increased incidence in females compared to non-DNMT3A-carriers, which rose to 2.09 for large clones (variant allele fraction ≥10%). In contrast, for ulcerative colitis, TET2 large clones were significantly associated, and only among individuals under 45. These associations were further identified using two-sample Mendelian randomization. In a mouse model of CHIP-IBD, HSC/Ps with Dnmt3a mutation demonstrated significantly worse pathophysiology compared to controls, due in part to heightened expression of Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in the bone marrow and colon. Treatment with the APE1/Ref-1 inhibitor APX3330 ameliorated CHIP-IBD driven by the Dnmt3a mutation.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a pivotal cytokine driving intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The development of monoclonal antibodies selectively targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23, including risankizumab, mirikizumab and guselkumab, has significantly expanded the therapeutic landscape of IBD. Landmark phase 3 trials in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have demonstrated high efficacy and durable responses, followed by recent regulatory approvals across both indications. Notably, the SEQUENCE trial established the superiority of risankizumab over ustekinumab in achieving endoscopic and clinical endpoints in CD, underscoring the therapeutic value of IL-23p19 blockade and its differentiation from prior p40 inhibition. With additional agents in advanced development, IL-23p19 inhibitors are now emerging as a bona fide treatment class in IBD. Furthermore, IL-23p19 inhibitors display favorable safety profiles and convenient subcutaneous administration regimens, which broaden their applicability across diverse patient populations. However, key knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal treatment positioning, comparative effectiveness, and long-term disease outcomes. Precision medicine approaches will be crucial to fully exploit the potential of this drug class. For instance, early biomarkers can help monitor response, while future integration of serological and multi-omics biomarkers may enable the prediction of treatment success and guide personalized selection. This review summarizes the current knowledge base regarding IL-23p19 inhibitors in IBD, highlights their class effects and unique clinical value, and outlines a research agenda towards biomarker-driven and precision-guided use. Ultimately, IL-23p19-inhibition exemplifies how targeted immunotherapy and precision medicine can converge in order to reshape IBD management.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer, with high mortality rates worldwide. The optimal treatment strategy for patients with multinodular early-stage HCC (BCLC-A) is still controversial, particularly regarding liver resection (LR), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with multinodular BCLC-A HCC treated with LR compared to RFA and TACE. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed by searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies comparing LR with RFA and TACE. Pooled analyses of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were performed using Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fifteen studies, including two randomized controlled trials and 13 cohort studies, with a total of 2,869 patients, were included. LR was significantly associated with improved OS (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.03-1.84; p = 0.01) and DFS (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.26-3.70; p = 0.001) compared with RFA. Similarly, LR demonstrated superior OS (HR 2.11; 95% CI 1.37-3.25; p < 0.0001) and DFS (HR 2.77; 95% CI 1.04-7.36; p = 0.04) when compared with TACE. The more pronounced benefit observed for DFS likely reflects improved local tumor control achieved with surgical resection. In selected patients with multinodular BCLC-A HCC and preserved liver function (predominantly Child-Pugh A or B), LR is associated with significant improvements in OS and DFS compared with RFA and TACE when liver transplantation is not feasible. These findings support reconsideration of current treatment algorithms to prioritize LR in appropriately selected candidates.</div>

            <div class="abs">Pathological complete response (pCR) following conversion therapy for initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) remains challenging to predict preoperatively. This study developed and validated a model integrating clinicopathological and radiomic features of tumor to predict pCR.<br><br>In this multi-center retrospective study, temporal radiomics features were extracted from baseline, post-treatment, and delta (change) MRIs. Serum AFP response was calculated as log₁₀(preoperative AFP)/log₁₀(baseline AFP). Univariate analysis, collinearity assessment, LASSO, and random forest were employed to perform feature selection. Fourteen machine learning models were benchmarked, with performance evaluated by using comprehensive metrics AUC, NPV, PPV, sensitivity, specificity, calibration, and decision curve analysis.<br><br>The model was developed and validated in a training (n=78), an internal test (n=32), and an independent validation cohort (n=44). The delta radiomic model significantly outperformed both baseline (test AUC: 0.835 vs. 0.483, p<0.05; validation AUC: 0.783 vs. 0.434, p<0.05) and preoperative models (test AUC: 0.685, p<0.05; validation AUC: 0.506, p<0.05), demonstrating superior predictive performance and generalization capability in predicting lesion-level pCR. Notably, when predicting patient-level pCR, the radiomic model also showed robust discrimination, with AUCs of 0.819 in the test set and 0.781 in the validation set.The combined radiomics-AFP model achieved even higher AUCs of 0.920 (test) and 0.857 (validation) in predicting lesion-level pCR.<br><br>Dynamic radiomic changes effectively predict pCR in uHCC after conversion therapy.

            <div class="abs">Non-alcoholic fatty pancreas (NAFP) is characterized by abnormal pancreatic fat accumulation and remains poorly understood.<br><br>This study investigates the therapeutic potential and mechanistic basis of low-dose amlodipine-perindopril combination therapy, hypothesizing dual calcium channel blockade and RAS inhibition synergistically disrupt ferroptotic-inflammatory cascades driving pancreatic lipotoxicity.<br><br>The bioinformatics analysis of GEO datasets (GSE40901, GSE101462, and GSE194331) identified differentially expressed genes, which were further validated through molecular docking studies with amlodipine and perindoprilat. Male Wistar rats (n = 30) were randomized into five groups: healthy control, NAFP (high-sugar/high-fat diet), amlodipine-treated, perindopril-treated, and combination therapy. Gene expression of GPX4, ACSL4, NLRP3, and rno-miR-762 was quantified by Real-Time PCR. Metabolic parameters, pancreatic histopathology, and immunohistochemical markers (caspase-1, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)) were assessed.<br><br>Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant alterations in ferroptosis and inflammatory pathways. Molecular docking demonstrated favorable binding affinities between therapeutic compounds and target proteins. NAFP induction resulted in GPX4 downregulation (0.471 ± 0.357 vs. 1.197 ± 0.449, P < 0.05), ACSL4 upregulation (48.633 ± 40.998 vs. 1.197 ± 0.445, p < 0.001), elevated NLRP3 (12.717 ± 7.904 vs. 1.115 ± 0.186, p < 0.001), and increased rno-miR-762 expression. The combination therapy achieved 73 % reduction in pancreatic adipocyte area (vs. 42 % with monotherapies, p < 0.001) through coordinated miR-762 suppression (↓68 %, q=0.003) and GPX4 protein restoration (↑2.1-fold, p = 0.008). NLRP3 inflammasome activity decreased by 89 % (p = 0.004). Crucially, the regimen preserved hemodynamic stability, demonstrating metabolic benefits without cardiovascular compromise.<br><br>These findings position miR-762 as a linchpin biomarker connecting metabolic stress to ferroptotic pancreatitis, with clinical translation challenges.

            <div class="abs">Patients with gastric cancer, biliary tract cancer (BTC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have poor survival outcomes and limited second- or later-line treatment options. Certain drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) signaling pathways are currently used in these cancers in specific circumstances; however, there remains a need for novel treatment combinations. LEAP-005 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 study that evaluated lenvatinib (multitargeted inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including VEGF) plus pembrolizumab (anti‒PD-1 monoclonal antibody) in select previously treated solid tumors.<br><br>Participants with previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC were enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G of LEAP-005, respectively, and received lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety.<br><br>Of 99, 102, and 103 total participants enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G, respectively, median times from first dose of study treatment to data cutoff (February 6, 2023) were 23.7, 24.2, and 19.5 months. ORRs (95% CI) by blinded independent central review were 15.2% (8.7%‒23.8%) in cohort C, 17.6% (10.8%‒26.4%) in cohort F, and 7.8% (3.4%‒14.7%) in cohort G. Grade 3‒5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54.5% of participants in cohort C, and grade 3‒4 (no grade 5) occurred in 60.8% and 59.2% of participants in cohorts F and G, respectively.<br><br>Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated modest antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC.</div>

            <div class="abs">This study seeks to elucidate the shared genetic underpinnings between these pulmonary diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on common genomic loci, implicated genes, and biochemical pathways.<br><br>This study is a genome-wide pleiotropic association study that utilized genome-wide association summary statistics from publicly available data sources. Diverse bioinformatics and statistical genetics strategies were applied to sequentially investigate the pleiotropic associations from single-nucleotide variant (SNV), gene-level data, and biological pathways, with the aim to better understand the shared genetic etiology between 3 pulmonary diseases and 7 neuropsychiatric disorders.<br><br>Significant genetic correlations and overlaps were observed among 20 of the 21 trait pairs. Pleiotropic analysis, using a composite null hypothesis, identified 3962 potentially pleiotropic SNVs across 20 trait pairs, along with 31 pleiotropic loci and 3 colocalized loci. Gene-based analysis revealed 103 unique candidate pleiotropic genes, which were notably enriched in phenotypes and tissues associated with the lung-brain axis (LBA). Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted key biological processes related to cell adhesion, synaptic structure and function, and immune cell differentiation. Several pleiotropic loci were also found to share causal variants with lung-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested vertical pleiotropy across 8 trait pairs.<br><br>These findings indicate that pleiotropic genetic factors connecting pulmonary and neuropsychiatric diseases are widely distributed throughout the genome.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>While some retrospective studies have reported that certain dietary habits may affect pancreatic cancer, the variety of dietary habits studied has been limited. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using exposure data from the UK Biobank data (n = 10,019,305) and outcome data from the FinnGen database (731 pancreatic cancer cases and 314,193 controls). Instrumental variables were selected based on genome-wide significance, followed by linkage disequilibrium clumping. Sensitivity analyses, including Steiger filtering and MR-PRESSO, were conducted to ensure the robustness of the causal inferences. Following this process, we extracted and filtered the data, ultimately selecting 30 dietary phenotypes from the original 231. Our findings revealed that alcohol intake frequency (raw P-value =.002, odds ratio (OR) = 1.090, 95% CI: 1.032-1.151) and average weekly spirits intake (raw P-value = .005, OR = 1.793, 95% CI: 1.196-2.688) were risk factors for pancreatic cancer using data from 706 single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from FinnGen database. Notably, cooked vegetable intake (raw P-value = .029, OR = 0.704, 95% CI: 0.514-0.965) was found to have a protective effect against pancreatic cancer. Our MR analysis provides evidence that specific dietary habits significantly influence pancreatic cancer risk, highlighting the potential of dietary interventions within public health strategies for pancreatic cancer management.</div>
