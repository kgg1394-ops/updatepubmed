            <div class="abs">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. The secretome, encompassing proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, has emerged as a promising tool for early detection, risk stratification, and therapeutic targeting in HCC. Recent studies suggest that secretome-derived biomarkers improve diagnostic accuracy and predict survival outcomes. However, variability in methodologies and findings necessitates a comprehensive synthesis of evidence.<br><br>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched on 2 May 2025 for studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of the secretome in HCC. Eligibility criteria included original research reporting sensitivity, specificity, or survival outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I² statistics.<br><br>Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The secretome demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with a pooled sensitivity of 95.9% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 40-100] and specificity of 89.6% (95% CI: 43.1-99). Moderate heterogeneity (I² = 44%) was observed. For survival outcomes, the pooled HR was 2.37 (95% CI: 0.87-6.41), though statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.07).<br><br>The secretome shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in HCC, with high sensitivity and specificity.

The article "Real-World Data on the Course of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis," published in an October 2024 supplement to The American Journal of Managed Care , highlights this limitation by focusing predominantly on objective clinical parameters while lacking systematic evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This gap is particularly relevant given limited evidence on how antifibrotic therapies affect symptoms, pulmonary function, and psychosocial well-being beyond radiologic progression. QOL is especially relevant in resource-limited settings, where demonstrating benefits in symptom control and functional status may influence therapeutic decisions, coverage policies, and resource allocation. Although international clinical practice guidelines, including those of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society, recognize QOL as a key domain in IPF management, they also acknowledge the paucity of evidence addressing psychosocial and functional outcomes. Notably, major clinical trials such as INPULSIS and ASCEND, while demonstrating efficacy in slowing forced vital capacity decline, did not incorporate HRQOL as a primary outcome. Recent guideline updates propose a conceptual framework integrating validated measures of symptoms, pulmonary function, and psychosocial impact. However, these dimensions have not yet been systematically embedded in clinical research. Reanalysis of existing data and future studies using this framework are warranted.

            <div class="abs">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with a high incidence and mortality rate worldwide. The existing treatment methods have limitations in terms of efficacy or applicable population. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two different antigens and are expected to overcome tumor immune escape, providing a new strategy for the treatment of CRC.<br><br>This study systematically retrieved clinical trial registration platforms such as Trialtrove and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July and November 2025, and collected trial data on the treatment of CRC with BsAbs. Descriptive analyses were conducted on key indicators such as the stage distribution, primary endpoints, funding types, global distribution, and target combinations of the trials by establishing clear inclusion and exclusion criteria.<br><br>A total of 192 clinical trials were included. Since 2018, the number of related trials has significantly increased, and the trial phase has shifted from mainly Phase I in the early stage to a substantial growth in Phase II and Phase III trials after 2023-2024. The primary endpoints of the trial were highly concentrated on safety assessment (such as safety/tolerability, adverse events). The industrial sector is the main funder (68.3%), and the number of trials conducted in China (n=125) ranks first in the world. The target combinations are most commonly PD-1/CTLA-4 and PD-1/VEGF, and studies on novel combinations such as EGFR/cMET are also on the rise. Efficacy data from key trials (e.g., Cadonilimab, Amivantamab) demonstrate encouraging response rates in both locally advanced and metastatic settings, particularly in MSS/pMMR populations.<br><br>The clinical research and development activities of BsAbs in the field of CRC treatment are becoming increasingly active and mature.

            <div class="abs">Observational studies show metformin use associated with lower cancer risk, although experimental evidence is inconsistent. To provide genetic validation for repositioning of metformin in cancer prevention, we assessed genetically proxied effects of putative metformin targets on cancer outcomes using a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) design.<br><br>We identified genetic proxies of 11 metformin targets (PRKAA1, PRKAA2, PRKAB1, PRKAB2, PRKAG1, PRKAG2, PRKAG3, ETFDH, GPD1, SLC47A1 and ACACB) based on their associations with tissue-specific gene expression, overall/sex-specific HbA1c and type 2 diabetes. We then evaluated genetically proxied effects of these targets on five major cancers using MR. We also employed a conventional MR design to assess the relationship of HbA1c with cancer using the inverse variance method, with sensitivity analyses. Associations were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates.<br><br>We identified two genetic proxies of putative metformin targets (PRKAG1 and GPD1) as valid instrumental variables (F statistics > 10). PRKAG1 was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (OR: 0.74 per mmol/mol reduction in overall HbA1c, 95% CI: 0.63-0.87; p = 0.001), with consistent findings in sex-specific analysis. This effect was unlikely mediated by HbA1c reduction, as indicated by conventional MR analyses (OR: 1.01 per mmol/mol, 95% CI: 0.99-1.02). No significant association was observed for GPD1 (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.74-1.36; p = 0.98).<br><br>Metformin may prevent colorectal cancer via the AMPKγ1 (PRKAG1) target based on genetic evidence, supporting the evaluation of metformin use in colorectal cancer prevention using randomised controlled trials.</div>

            <div class="abs">Abattoir surveillance is the font of valuable information on the incidence and epidemiology of animal disease, having both public and animal health importance. A cross-sectional study followed by simple random sampling was conducted from December 2021 to May 2022 to identify the major causes of edible offal condemnation and to estimate the financial losses attributed to edible offal condemnation in cattle slaughtered at Bahir Dar municipal abattoir, northwestern Ethiopia, using antemortem and post-mortem examination.<br><br>Out of 334 cattle investigated, 3.6% (12/334) cattle showed detectable abnormalities including diarrhoea in 0.6% (2/12), lameness in 0.9% (3/12) and tick infestation in 1.2% (4/12), and nasal discharge in 0.9% (3/12) in cattle during an antemortem examination. However, in post-mortem examination, 22.16% (74/334) of cattle revealed lesions in visceral organs including the liver (14.6%), lung (9.9%), kidney (1.8%), heart (2.4%) and tongue (0.9%). The major causes that were identified in the current study include calcification, fasciolosis, hydatid cyst, cirrhosis, abscess, pneumonia, haemorrhage, emphysema, congestion, pericarditis, Cysticercus bovis, nephritis and renal calculi. Among the putative risk factors, only body condition was shown to have statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) with the prevalence of major causes of organ condemnation upon post-mortem examination. The overall financial losses incurred due to organ condemnation were estimated to be $475.19, with an annual loss of $15,447.85.<br><br>The current study implies that there was considerable edible offal condemnation resulting in significant economic loss.

            <div class="abs">Cystic fibrosis (CF) alters gut physiology, yet its impact on microbial communities across colonic regions (ascending, transverse, descending colon) and microhabitats (lumen, mucosa) remains incompletely understood. Here, we applied culturomics to characterize gut microbiota in a small cohort of 32 individuals (22 non-CF, 10 CF). Persons with CF (pwCF) exhibited significantly higher viable bacterial loads than non-CF individuals, particularly in mucosal samples. Anaerobes predominated overall, with relative enrichment of aerobes in the mucosa of pwCF. Alpha diversity was reduced in mucosal samples and aerobic cultures for pwCF, whereas beta diversity was influenced by all the tested variables except the colonic region. Phylum-level analyses revealed enrichment of Proteobacteria and depletion of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes in samples from pwCF, consistent with stool analysis. Random forest models identified selected oral-associated microbes as key predictive taxa and accurately classified polyp status within this cohort.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) increases cardiovascular and pancreatitis risk. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies like volanesorsen and olezarsen target ApoC-III mRNA to reduce ApoC-III, enhancing lipoprotein lipase activity and lowering triglycerides (TGs). This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of these ASOs in severe HTG. A systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42024577110) was conducted following PRISMA, sourcing studies from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving severe HTG (≥200 mg/dL) treated with volanesorsen or olezarsen vs. placebo were included. Data were synthesized using a random effects model in RevMan 5.4, and bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. Of 31 identified articles, 9 RCTs (341 patients treated with ASOs, 209 controls) were included. ASOs significantly reduced TG levels [mean difference (MD): -53.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): -77.04 to -30.40; p<0.00001]. Reductions were also seen in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -55.76; p<0.00001), ApoC-III (MD: -74.78; p<0.00001), and APOB48 (MD: -69.45; p<0.00001). Olezarsen uniquely reduced APOB (MD: -15.60; p<0.00001). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased (MD: -23.25; p<0.00001), while HDL-C increased (MD: +42.14; p<0.00001). Volanesorsen was linked to higher low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (MD: +62.74; p=0.004). For safety, local injection reactions, thrombocytopenia, and nausea were more common with volanesorsen. Acute pancreatitis occurred only in the placebo group (relative risk: 0.15; p=0.0004), indicating ASO protection. This meta-analysis confirms that ASOs effectively lower TGs and improve lipid profiles in severe HTG.</div>

LEAP-005 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 2 study that evaluated lenvatinib (multitargeted inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including VEGF) plus pembrolizumab (anti‒PD-1 monoclonal antibody) in select previously treated solid tumors.<br><br>Participants with previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC were enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G of LEAP-005, respectively, and received lenvatinib 20 mg/day orally plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety.<br><br>Of 99, 102, and 103 total participants enrolled in cohorts C, F, and G, respectively, median times from first dose of study treatment to data cutoff (February 6, 2023) were 23.7, 24.2, and 19.5 months. ORRs (95% CI) by blinded independent central review were 15.2% (8.7%‒23.8%) in cohort C, 17.6% (10.8%‒26.4%) in cohort F, and 7.8% (3.4%‒14.7%) in cohort G. Grade 3‒5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54.5% of participants in cohort C, and grade 3‒4 (no grade 5) occurred in 60.8% and 59.2% of participants in cohorts F and G, respectively.<br><br>Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab demonstrated modest antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in previously treated, advanced gastric cancer, BTC, and PDAC.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>These findings indicate that pleiotropic genetic factors connecting pulmonary and neuropsychiatric diseases are widely distributed throughout the genome. This provides robust evidence for a shared genetic basis underlying the lung-brain axis and has important implications for the potential for developing targeted intervention and treatment that simultaneously address both diseases types.</div>
            <div class="abs">This study seeks to elucidate the shared genetic underpinnings between these pulmonary diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on common genomic loci, implicated genes, and biochemical pathways.<br><br>This study is a genome-wide pleiotropic association study that utilized genome-wide association summary statistics from publicly available data sources. Diverse bioinformatics and statistical genetics strategies were applied to sequentially investigate the pleiotropic associations from single-nucleotide variant (SNV), gene-level data, and biological pathways, with the aim to better understand the shared genetic etiology between 3 pulmonary diseases and 7 neuropsychiatric disorders.<br><br>Significant genetic correlations and overlaps were observed among 20 of the 21 trait pairs. Pleiotropic analysis, using a composite null hypothesis, identified 3962 potentially pleiotropic SNVs across 20 trait pairs, along with 31 pleiotropic loci and 3 colocalized loci. Gene-based analysis revealed 103 unique candidate pleiotropic genes, which were notably enriched in phenotypes and tissues associated with the lung-brain axis (LBA). Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted key biological processes related to cell adhesion, synaptic structure and function, and immune cell differentiation. Several pleiotropic loci were also found to share causal variants with lung-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested vertical pleiotropy across 8 trait pairs.<br><br>These findings indicate that pleiotropic genetic factors connecting pulmonary and neuropsychiatric diseases are widely distributed throughout the genome. This provides robust evidence for a shared genetic basis underlying the lung-brain axis and has important implications for the potential for developing targeted intervention and treatment that simultaneously address both diseases types.</div>
