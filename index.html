            <div class="abs">Endoscopic ultrasound-guided pancreatic duct drainage (EUS-PDD) is becoming an alternative treatment in patients with difficult retrograde access to the pancreatic duct due to difficulty in cannulation or surgically altered anatomy. This is narrative review for technical tips and outcomes for EUS-PDD. EUS-PDD is performed via one of two approaches: EUS-guided rendezvous and EUS-guided transmural drainage and involves the insertion of plastic or metal stents. While the use of plastic has been extensively described, fully covered self-expandable metal stents were reported in only six studies, and with a small number of patients. A meta-analysis including 27 trials and 902 patients reported technical success, clinical success, and adverse event (AE) rates of 89%, 88%, and 17%, respectively. The most common AE for post-EUS-PDD was acute pancreatitis, which occurred at a rate of 3%. The cumulative rates of bleeding, perforation, pancreatic leak, and infection were 2%, 2%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. The re-intervention rate due to stent dislocation, occlusion, or other reasons was 19%. In cases of surgically altered anatomy, the EUS-guided approach is significantly superior to the enteroscopy-guided approach with regard to pancreatic duct opacification (87% vs 30%; </div>

            <div class="abs">Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and microsatellite instability (MSI-H) cancers exhibit high immunogenicity and are highly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In patients with locally advanced dMMR/MSI-H colorectal cancer (CRC), neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NIT) has demonstrated unprecedented pathological complete response (pCR) rates, suggesting nonoperative management strategies may be possible. There remains a discrepancy between radiological assessment and pathological responses to NIT in CRC.<br><br>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between February 2015 and February 2025 to determine if radiological and pathological assessments following neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (NIT) were consistent in patients with non-metastatic dMMR/MSI-H CRC. Using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, the literature was retrieved, with inclusion criteria focusing on studies that reported both imaging data and pathological results. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on tumor location (colon versus rectum) and type of response (cCR versus pCR).<br><br>In 12 studies, 396 patients were included. A total rate of 59.6% discordance was found between radiological and pathological responses. Compared to rectal cancer patients (34.9%), colon cancer patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of discordance (64.2%). A total of 238 patients with confirmed pCR were incorrectly diagnosed as having residual disease on radiological assessment (OR = 61.41; 95% CI: 10.05–375.27;P < 0.00001). A high level of heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2 = 85%), but no publication bias was observed.<br><br>In dMMR/MSI-H CRC, radiologic assessment alone cannot reliably assess the efficacy of NIT, particularly in colon cancer. It should be integrated with additional modalities—such as endoscopic evaluation and biomarker analysis—to ensure an accurate appraisal of treatment efficacy.</div>

Adults with mCRC were grouped by first exposure to FTD-TPI versus FTD-TPI+bev. Propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts based on patient characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to describe the real-world overall survival (rwOS, the primary outcome), time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD), and time to next treatment or death (rwTTNTD).<br><br>This cohort included 3151 patients treated with FTD-TPI and 529 patients treated with FTD-TPI+bev. After propensity score matching, 472 patients were included in each cohort with balanced patient characteristics. The median rwOS was 8.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.8 to 10.1) for FTD-TPI+bev and 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 6.7) for FTD-TPI (P<0.001). The median rwTTD was 3.5 months (95% CI, 3.2 to 3.8) in the FTD-TPI+bev group and 2.2 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.5) in the FTD-TPI group. The median rwTTNTD among the FTD-TPI+bev group was 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.4) and in the FTD-TPI group it was 3.5 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 3.7).<br><br>This U.S.-based real-world observational study found that FTD-TPI+bev was associated with longer rwOS compared with FTD-TPI in patients with mCRC. These findings align with the results of the SUNLIGHT clinical trial. (Funded by Taiho Oncology, Inc. and others.).</div>

This is narrative review for technical tips and outcomes for EUS-PDD. EUS-PDD is performed via one of two approaches: EUS-guided rendezvous and EUS-guided transmural drainage and involves the insertion of plastic or metal stents. While the use of plastic has been extensively described, fully covered self-expandable metal stents were reported in only six studies, and with a small number of patients. A meta-analysis including 27 trials and 902 patients reported technical success, clinical success, and adverse event (AE) rates of 89%, 88%, and 17%, respectively. The most common AE for post-EUS-PDD was acute pancreatitis, which occurred at a rate of 3%. The cumulative rates of bleeding, perforation, pancreatic leak, and infection were 2%, 2%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. The re-intervention rate due to stent dislocation, occlusion, or other reasons was 19%. In cases of surgically altered anatomy, the EUS-guided approach is significantly superior to the enteroscopy-guided approach with regard to pancreatic duct opacification (87% vs 30%; </div>

            <div class="abs">While some retrospective studies have reported that certain dietary habits may affect pancreatic cancer, the variety of dietary habits studied has been limited. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using exposure data from the UK Biobank data (n = 10,019,305) and outcome data from the FinnGen database (731 pancreatic cancer cases and 314,193 controls). Instrumental variables were selected based on genome-wide significance, followed by linkage disequilibrium clumping. Sensitivity analyses, including Steiger filtering and MR-PRESSO, were conducted to ensure the robustness of the causal inferences. Following this process, we extracted and filtered the data, ultimately selecting 30 dietary phenotypes from the original 231. Our findings revealed that alcohol intake frequency (raw P-value =.002, odds ratio (OR) = 1.090, 95% CI: 1.032-1.151) and average weekly spirits intake (raw P-value = .005, OR = 1.793, 95% CI: 1.196-2.688) were risk factors for pancreatic cancer using data from 706 single nucleotide polymorphisms derived from FinnGen database. Notably, cooked vegetable intake (raw P-value = .029, OR = 0.704, 95% CI: 0.514-0.965) was found to have a protective effect against pancreatic cancer. Our MR analysis provides evidence that specific dietary habits significantly influence pancreatic cancer risk, highlighting the potential of dietary interventions within public health strategies for pancreatic cancer management.</div>
