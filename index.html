                <div class="abs">Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a major public health challenge closely linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Effective, durable weight-loss strategies are needed to modify its natural history, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with limited response to pharmacotherapy.<br><br>This review summarizes current and emerging weight-loss approaches for MASLD, focusing on pharmacological therapies, bariatric surgery and endoscopic interventions. From an expert narrative perspective, we discuss key randomized and observational studies on endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), cost-effectiveness analyses, and the limited evidence in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD), who represent an unmet need.<br><br>ESG could be a promising, minimally invasive option for patients with MASLD who are ineligible for bariatric surgery or refractory to medical therapy. Early data suggest clinically meaningful weight loss, metabolic improvement, and a favorable safety profile, but long-term outcomes and direct histological benefits remain to be defined, particularly in patients with advanced fibrosis or cACLD. Combining ESG with pharmacological agents, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, theoretically may enhance outcomes and deserves further study. Well-designed trials are required to better define the role of ESG in MASLD management and its potential integration into clinical practice.</div>

                <div class="abs">Amivantamab is a bispecific, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET-proto-oncogene (MET)-targeting antibody with immune cell-directing activity. In the global Phase 3 PAPILLON trial, amivantamab plus carboplatin-pemetrexed (amivantamab-chemotherapy) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs chemotherapy alone in previously untreated participants with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions (Ex20ins). We evaluated clinical outcomes in Asian participants in PAPILLON (NCT04538664).<br><br>Participants were randomized 1:1 to amivantamab-chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Study endpoints for this analysis were PFS by blinded independent central review (primary), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), PFS after first subsequent therapy (PFS2), overall survival (OS), and safety (secondary). Crossover to amivantamab monotherapy was allowed when disease progressed on chemotherapy alone.<br><br>Among 186 participants in the Asian sub-cohort, 97 received amivantamab-chemotherapy and 89 received chemotherapy. At median follow-up of 16.6 months, median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in the amivantamab-chemotherapy/chemotherapy groups was 11.5/5.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.34; 95%CI, 0.23-0.49; nominal p < 0.0001) arms. The ORR was 70% vs 51% (odds ratio 2.2, 95%CI, 1.2-3.9; nominal p = 0.012), DoR 10.1 vs 5.5 months. Median PFS2 was not estimable vs 18.8 months (HR 0.46, 95%CI 0.26-0.83; nominal p = 0.008), and median interim OS not estimable vs 24.4 months HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.34-1.24; nominal p = 0.189), respectively, despite substantial (73%) crossover. Safety profiles for both arms were similar to the overall PAPILLON population.<br><br>Amivantamab-chemotherapy demonstrated superior PFS vs chemotherapy and represents a new standard of care for first-line treatment of Asian participants with Ex20ins-mutated NSCLC.</div>

                <div class="abs">Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a biologically coherent strategy to modulate the gut-liver axis by restoring ecosystem structure and function. This chapter synthesizes current evidence and practice of FMT in various liver disease conditions. In cirrhosis with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE), randomized trials demonstrate adjunctive benefits of FMT, reducing recurrence and hospitalizations as well as improving cognition, with route flexibility (lower-GI infusions or oral capsules) and emerging microbiome predictors of response. In severe alcohol-associated hepatitis and ACLF, early single-center trials suggest fewer infections and short-term survival gains, warranting confirmation in multicenter, blinded studies for further outcomes. For MASLD/MASH, FMT consistently shifts intestinal permeability, bile-acid signatures, and hepatic transcriptomics, although it has not reliably improved MRI-PDFF or insulin resistance in unselected cohorts; future success likely requires phenotype enrichment and function-matched donors or defined consortia. Data in chronic hepatitis B remain exploratory, positioning FMT, if at all, as an adjunct to antivirals. Methods are standardized around rigorous donor screening, controlled manufacturing, indication-specific endpoints, and strain-resolved engraftment analytics linking mechanism to outcome. Refractory Clostridium difficile is the only FDA-approved indication of FMT. Use of FMT in hepatology use should remain protocolled and regulated. Priorities include precision donor matching, next-generation consortia, platform trials, and long-term safety registries.</div>

                <div class="abs">This prospective Phase 2 trial investigates efficacy and side effects of ultrasound-guided salvage brachytherapy with interstitial hyperthermia in locally recurrent prostate cancer following previous radiation therapy.<br><br>Altogether 109 patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous external beam radiation therapy were enrolled in this Phase 2, multicentric prospective trial between 2015 and 2020. Patients received either 30 Gy in three fractions 21 days apart (78.0 Gy, EQD2, α/ β = 3 Gy) using interstitial HDR-brachytherapy alone or 60 Gy in 2 sessions 28 days apart (71.5 Gy (EQD2, α/β = 3 Gy) using interstitial PDR-brachytherapy alone. We performed the interstitial brachytherapy in all patients with plastic needles. Additionally, interstitial hyperthermia treatment was executed within one hour before or during every brachytherapy fraction/series for a therapeutic time of 60 min and a target temperature of 40-41 °C, at least. The primary endpoint of this prospective phase 2 trial was rate of late Grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) side effects. Treatment-related toxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE). Secondary endpoints were cumulative local recurrence rate, biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS), overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03238066.<br><br>Median follow-up was 64 months. Median time between previous radiation therapy and salvage brachytherapy was 77 months (range 20.4 - 244 months). Serious late toxicity was generally low. Importantly we did not register any grade ≥ 2 of late rectal toxicities. We observed Grade 3 urinary incontinence in 8/109 patients (7.3%), with further seven patients scoring urinary incontinence Grade 1 or 2 toxicity (7/109, 6.4%). All other late urogenital side effects were only grade 1 or 2: urinary retention by 8/109 (7.2%), urinary frequency 5/109 (4.6%) and urinary urgency in 2/109 patients (1.8%). The cumulative 5 years local recurrence rate (cLRR) and cumulative lymph-node recurrence rate (cLndRR) for all patients was 29% and 6.8%, respectively. Five years-biochemical disease-free survival estimates according Kaplan-Meier were 58.9%. Five years metastases-free survival, cancer specific survival and overall survival estimates according Kaplan-Meier were 77.7%, 92.7% and 85.5%, respectively.<br><br>Salvage brachytherapy with interstitial hyperthermia in local recurrent, previously irradiated, prostate cancer is effective with very low late toxicity. Since there are no meaningful randomized comparative studies available, it remains unclear whether the additional use of interstitial hyperthermia can further improve the effectiveness of salvage brachytherapy alone.</div>

Follow-up was completed on February 16, 2024. This analysis was not prespecified in the trial protocol.<br><br>Participants were randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab, 200 mg (2 mg/kg for pediatric participants), or placebo, every 3 weeks for no more than 17 cycles.<br><br>Secondary analyses of incidence and time to diagnosis of new melanoma or other cutaneous malignant neoplasm, sensitivity analysis of recurrence-free survival (RFS) with new primary melanoma counted as an event, and incidence of immune-mediated severe skin reactions.<br><br>A total of 976 participants were assigned to treatment (487 to pembrolizumab and 489 to placebo), of whom 589 (60.3%) were male (median age at diagnosis, 61 [IQR, 52-69] years). The median follow-up was 52.8 (range, 39.4-64.8) months. In the pembrolizumab group, 37 participants (7.6%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 168.0 [range, 1.0-1182.0] days); 12 (2.5%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 6 (1.2%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 19 (3.9%) had basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and 9 (1.8%) had cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). In the placebo group, 56 participants (11.5%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 177.0 [range, 1.0-1043.0] days); 9 (1.8%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 9 (1.8%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 26 (5.3%) had BCC, and 17 (3.5%) had cSCC. Median RFS with new primary melanoma counted as an event was not reached with pembrolizumab and was 59.2 months (95% CI, 53.9 months to not reached) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.80); 48-month RFS was 68.7% and 56.5%, respectively. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred in 16 of 483 participants (3.3%) in the pembrolizumab group and 3 of 486 (0.6%) in the placebo group (grade 3 or 4: 14 [2.9%] vs 3 [0.6%]).<br><br>In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the incidence of new primary melanoma was not different between groups, whereas nonmelanoma skin cancers were more common with placebo. The RFS benefit of pembrolizumab remained after accounting for new primary melanomas. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred infrequently and were manageable. These findings support the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in high-risk stage II melanoma.<br><br>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03553836.</div>

Radiotherapy was delivered in five alternate-day fractions using an Adapt-to-Shape workflow. The primary endpoint was clinician-reported acute grade ≥ 2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity within 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included late toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and survival outcomes.<br><br>Median follow-up was 17.2 months (range, 4.3–49.3). The median on-couch time was 59 min (range, 35–80). Acute grade ≥ 2 GU and GI toxicities occurred in 5.7% of patients each, including one grade 3 GI event; all resolved within 8 weeks. No late grade ≥ 2 toxicities were observed, and no grade 1 events persisted beyond 18 months. QoL scores declined at 2 weeks post-treatment but returned to baseline by 3 months.

                <div class="abs">Cochrane Rehabilitation and the World Health Organization (WHO) Rehabilitation Programme have collaborated to produce four Cochrane overviews of systematic reviews that synthesize current available evidence from health policy and systems research (HPSR) in rehabilitation. Each overview focuses on one of the four pillars of HPSR as identified by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) taxonomy: delivery arrangements, financial arrangements, governance arrangements, and implementation strategies. This overview focuses on financial arrangements, which Cochrane EPOC defines as changes in how funds are collected, how insurance schemes are structured, how services are purchased, and the use of targeted financial incentives or disincentives.<br><br>This overview aimed to synthesize the current evidence on financial arrangements in rehabilitation from a health policy and systems research (HPSR) perspective. Our series of four overviews, incorporating evidence on governance arrangements, delivery arrangements, financial arrangements, and implementation strategies, have the following overarching objectives. • To offer a broad synthesis of the existing evidence on health policy and systems interventions' effects. • To direct end-users, including policymakers, towards systematic reviews that may address their health policy questions. • To identify current research gaps and set priorities for future primary HPSR. • To pinpoint the needs and priorities for new evidence syntheses where no reliable, up-to-date systematic reviews currently exist.<br><br>We searched the Epistemonikos database, the Health Systems Evidence database, and EPOC Group systematic reviews to identify reviews published between 1 January 2015 and 17 November 2024. We applied no language limitations. We included Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) that evaluated the effectiveness of health policy and systems interventions for rehabilitation in health systems, specifically related to financial arrangements as defined in the EPOC taxonomy. All four overview teams collaborated to screen reviews and extract data. We used AMSTAR 2 to critically appraise the quality of the reviews. Reviews with ratings of high-to-moderate confidence are reported separately from low-confidence reviews.<br><br>We identified two non-Cochrane systematic reviews relevant to rehabilitation and the EPOC category of financial arrangements. We excluded one review from the synthesis due to low methodological quality. The other review included 18 primary studies, but only one study reported data relevant to rehabilitation. This study, conducted in a single country (China), compared insured and uninsured children aged birth to 17 years with intellectual disabilities, focusing on the likelihood of receiving at least one rehabilitation service. The review reported that, based on this single study, enrollment in social health insurance, national health insurance, or community-based health insurance schemes may be ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠associated with increased utilization of mental health services, including outpatient rehabilitation. However, due to the complexity and variability of mental health service utilization across contexts, the review authors noted that it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the overall impact of insurance enrollment on mental health outcomes and services.<br><br>We identified two non-Cochrane systematic reviews aligned with the EPOC classification of financial arrangements that addressed rehabilitation. One review including one single-center study on rehabilitation offered low-certainty evidence on insurance schemes and access to rehabilitation services. As a result, this overview cannot provide a clear understanding of the effects of financial arrangements for rehabilitation or offer meaningful signposts to end-users, including policymakers. Future Cochrane overviews in HPSR should broaden their scope to include qualitative and mixed-methods study designs. Robust primary studies and inclusive systematic reviews are urgently needed to guide financial policy decisions that integrate rehabilitation into resilient and equitable health systems.<br><br>PC, CK, and SN were supported and funded by the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente).

                <div class="abs">Combination therapy with vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab has previously shown promising antitumor activity in melanoma. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vibostolimab coformulated with pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for high-risk resected melanoma.<br><br>This randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study was done at 205 global sites (hospitals and cancer centres). Participants aged 12 years or older with surgically resected, stage IIB-IV cutaneous melanoma per the American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual 2017 (8th edition), with no evidence of metastatic disease after resection, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive vibostolimab 200 mg coformulated with pembrolizumab 200 mg or pembrolizumab 200 mg alone intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was done using an interactive response technology system and was stratified by risk-based staging and geographical region. Participants, investigators, and site staff were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the study treatment. The protocol-prespecified first interim analysis was an event-driven nonbinding futility analysis of recurrence-free survival that was planned for when 111 events had occurred (futility bar of observed HR 0·95). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05665595), and is closed to recruitment.<br><br>Between Jan 19, 2023, and March 6, 2024, 1402 participants were randomly assigned to receive coformulated vibostolimab-pembrolizumab (n=701) or pembrolizumab (n=701). At the first interim analysis, median study follow-up, defined as time from randomisation to data cutoff, was 4·2 months (IQR 1·9-6·7). The median age was 61·0 years (IQR 51·0-70·0), 829 (59%) of 1402 participants were male and 573 (41%) were female. 1107 (79%) of participants were White, 273 (19%) were Asian, and 22 (2%) were of other race or race was missing. At the time of the first interim analysis, a total of 119 (8%) of 1402 participants had had a recurrence-free survival event, including 67 (10%) of 701 in the vibostolimab-pembrolizumab group and 52 (7%) of 701 in the pembrolizumab alone group. The median recurrence-free survival was not reached in either group; the hazard ratio for recurrence-free survival in the vibostolimab-pembrolizumab group versus pembrolizumab alone group was 1·25 (95% CI 0·9-1·8). The most common (occurred in more than five participants) grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were adrenal insufficiency in 13 (2%) participants, hepatitis in 11 (2%) participants, rash in 9 (1%) participants, maculopapular rash in 7 (1%) participants, and pruritus in 6 (1%) participants in the vibostolimab-pembrolizumab group and increased alanine aminotransferase in 7 (1%) participants in the pembrolizumab alone group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 74 (11%) participants and 30 (4%) participants, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in two (<1%) participants in the vibostolimab-pembrolizumab group (myasthenia gravis and myocarditis) and one participant (<1%) in the pembrolizumab group (myositis).

A series of analyses, including functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networking, survival analysis, and immune infiltration profiling, were performed to screen for and characterize hub genes. Subsequently, the expression of key hubs—NFE2L2 (NRF2), TGFB1, and TP53—was validated in PDAC patient tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Their biological functions were investigated via shRNA-mediated knockdown in BxPC-3 cells, followed by assays for cell migration (wound healing, transwell) and ferroptosis (ROS, MDA, GSH/GSSG).<br><br>Bioinformatic analysis identified 221 ferroptosis-related DEGs. NFE2L2, TGFB1, and TP53 emerged as core hub genes whose high expression correlated with poor patient survival and specific immune infiltration patterns. Experimental validation confirmed that NRF2, TGFβ1, and TP53 proteins were significantly upregulated in PDAC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Functionally, knockdown of NFE2L2 and TGFB1 suppressed PDAC cell migration, whereas TP53 knockdown enhanced it.

                <div class="abs">Lactate has been shown to protect cells against oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death driven by oxidative stress, characterized by glutathione depletion and elevated lipid peroxidation. It is hypothesized that lactate may modulate the ferroptotic process in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.<br><br>In this study, the Molecular Signatures Database was leveraged to identify key differentially expressed HCC-related lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs). The functions and interactions of these genes were analyzed through Cytoscape network analyses, biological process annotation, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. A prognostic risk model based on these genes was constructed utilizing Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms were used to assess immune infiltration in individual samples.<br><br>Comprehensive analysis revealed that LMRGs and FRGs are co-involved in processes such as the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant detoxification. Based on the expression profiles of these genes, HCC patients were stratified into four distinct subgroups. These subgroups exhibited significant heterogeneity in gene expression profiles, immunological characteristics, metabolic activity patterns, mutational landscapes, immune microenvironment features, and drug sensitivity levels. tRNA mitochondrial 2-thiouridylase (TRMU) was identified as a highly expressed LMRG in HCC. Knockdown of TRMU inhibited HCC cell proliferation and migration, accompanied by elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and depleted glutathione (GSH) levels, indicating that TRMU silencing induces oxidative stress and facilitates ferroptosis.<br><br>An interplay exists between lactate metabolism and ferroptosis pathways in HCC, and the constructed risk model demonstrates predictive value for patient prognosis. As a critical gene, TRMU promotes HCC progression and suppresses ferroptosis through its high expression, suggesting it serves as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.<br><br>1. The present results highlight the crosstalk between lactate metabolism and ferroptosis pathways in HCC cells. 2. Further studies of the regulatory interplay between these two important pathways may ultimately lead to the design of novel treatments for HCC. 3. Moreover, the LMRG tRNA mitochondrial 2-thiouridylase (TRMU) was found to be upregulated in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Knocking down this gene was sufficient to suppress the proliferative and migratory activity of these HCC cells while driving oxidative stress induction and ferroptotic death therein.</div>
