            <div class="abs">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. The secretome, encompassing proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, has emerged as a promising tool for early detection, risk stratification, and therapeutic targeting in HCC. Recent studies suggest that secretome-derived biomarkers improve diagnostic accuracy and predict survival outcomes. However, variability in methodologies and findings necessitates a comprehensive synthesis of evidence.<br><br>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched on 2 May 2025 for studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of the secretome in HCC. Eligibility criteria included original research reporting sensitivity, specificity, or survival outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I² statistics.<br><br>Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The secretome demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with a pooled sensitivity of 95.9% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 40-100] and specificity of 89.6% (95% CI: 43.1-99). Moderate heterogeneity (I² = 44%) was observed. For survival outcomes, the pooled HR was 2.37 (95% CI: 0.87-6.41), though statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.07).<br><br>The secretome shows promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in HCC, with high sensitivity and specificity.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive and effective treatment for large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps; however, it carries a relevant risk of adverse events (AEs), such as delayed bleeding, as well as postprocedural perforation (PPP) and postelectrocoagulation syndrome (PECS). Systematic defect closure may reduce these risks, but its preventive efficacy remains uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of prophylactic clipping after colorectal ESD.Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS through to June 2025 for RCTs comparing prophylactic clipping vs. no clipping after colorectal ESD in adults. The primary outcome was clinically significant delayed bleeding; secondary outcomes included PPP and PECS, as well as subanalysis by location and size. Random-effects models were used to compute risk ratios (RRs) and 95%CIs.Four RCTs from Asia including 684 patients were analyzed (336 with clipping, 348 controls). Prophylactic clipping significantly reduced clinically significant delayed bleeding risk (0.3% vs. 3.4%; RR 0.26, 95%CI 0.08-0.88). No significant differences were found for PPP (0.4% vs. 1.0%; RR 0.74; 95%CI 0.23-2.35) or PECS (12.2% vs. 11.8%; RR 1.06; 95%CI 0.74-1.52). Subgroup analyses by lesion size (>30 mm vs. <30 mm) and location (proximal vs. distal colon) were not significant.A 74% decrease in the risk of clinically significant delayed bleeding is achieved by prophylactic clipping after colorectal ESD, supporting its adoption in routine practice.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>SUMOylation is a critical post-translational modification of proteins. However, the roles of SUMOylation-related genes in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment and their potential as therapeutic targets in CRC remain unclear. We integrated transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO to identify 200 SUMOylation-related genes associated with prognosis. Among these, 58 genes exhibiting significant survival differences were selected and classified into three distinct clusters. Cluster C patients have the worst prognosis, linked to increased tumor proliferation and weakened immune responses. The LASSO combined with Random Survival Forest (RSF) approach demonstrated optimal performance in ten machine learning algorithms, yielding the highest C-index (0.715). Subsequently, six key genes-SENP7, NUP85, UHRF2, BRCA1, TOPORS, and SENP5-were selected using the LASSO-RSF framework to develop a refined prognostic model. This model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival AUC values of 0.943, 0.961, and 0.981, respectively. Furthermore, the risk score derived from the model was significantly correlated not only with tumor metastasis and recurrence, advanced tumor stage, and patient age, but also with immune cell infiltration, tumor mutational burden, and sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Single-cell analysis revealed that the core gene UHRF2 is highly expressed in CD8 + exhausted T cells, but exhibits low expression in conventional CD8 + T cells and natural killer cells. Experimental data demonstrated that UHRF2 was upregulated in CRC and linked to poor prognosis. Silencing UHRF2 markedly inhibited both proliferation and migration of tumor cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, the prognostic model derived from SUMOylation-related genes demonstrates robust predictive accuracy for patient outcomes. UHRF2 is associated with immunosuppression and promotes CRC progression, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target in CRC.</div>

            <div class="abs">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with a high incidence and mortality rate worldwide. The existing treatment methods have limitations in terms of efficacy or applicable population. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two different antigens and are expected to overcome tumor immune escape, providing a new strategy for the treatment of CRC.<br><br>This study systematically retrieved clinical trial registration platforms such as Trialtrove and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July and November 2025, and collected trial data on the treatment of CRC with BsAbs. Descriptive analyses were conducted on key indicators such as the stage distribution, primary endpoints, funding types, global distribution, and target combinations of the trials by establishing clear inclusion and exclusion criteria.<br><br>A total of 192 clinical trials were included. Since 2018, the number of related trials has significantly increased, and the trial phase has shifted from mainly Phase I in the early stage to a substantial growth in Phase II and Phase III trials after 2023-2024. The primary endpoints of the trial were highly concentrated on safety assessment (such as safety/tolerability, adverse events). The industrial sector is the main funder (68.3%), and the number of trials conducted in China (n=125) ranks first in the world. The target combinations are most commonly PD-1/CTLA-4 and PD-1/VEGF, and studies on novel combinations such as EGFR/cMET are also on the rise. Efficacy data from key trials (e.g., Cadonilimab, Amivantamab) demonstrate encouraging response rates in both locally advanced and metastatic settings, particularly in MSS/pMMR populations.<br><br>The clinical research and development activities of BsAbs in the field of CRC treatment are becoming increasingly active and mature.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Nearly one-third of patients with IBD in this study escalated their biologic dose, which significantly increased their disease-related health care costs. These results demonstrate current challenges in long-term biologic therapy in IBD and highlight the ongoing need for further research into biologic management strategies to optimize IBD patient care and long-term outcomes, while containing costs.</div>
            <div class="abs">Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), composed of Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), frequently employs biologics to help control inflammation, reduce symptom burden, and limit disease progression. Because of both the lifelong, progressive nature of disease and potential for loss of therapy response over time, therapy changes are common. Biologic dose escalation is one method to adjust therapy regimens following loss of response.<br><br>To assess the occurrence of dose escalation in CD and UC and its influence on health care costs.<br><br>Adults with a diagnosis of CD or UC newly initiating therapy with a biologic (adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab, or tofacitinib [UC only]) from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2022, were selected in the Merative MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Databases. The first claim for the biologic served as the index date and patients were followed over a 12-month pre-period and a 12-month-or-longer post-period. Dose escalation during the maintenance phase of therapy, discontinuation, and postdiscontinuation switching were assessed in biologic-based subgroups in each of the CD and UC cohorts; per-patient-per-month (PPPM) IBD-related health care costs over the duration of index biologic treatment were also calculated.<br><br>Analyses included 6,056 patients with CD (33.5% adalimumab, 30.6% ustekinumab, 18.8% infliximab, 17.1% vedolizumab) and 4,533 patients with UC (35.1% vedolizumab, 30.6% adalimumab, 16.8% infliximab, 10.0% ustekinumab, 7.5% tofacitinib). Dose escalation occurred in 30.4% of patients with CD (adalimumab 20.8%, infliximab 48.8%, ustekinumab 26.9%, vedolizumab 36.2%) and 30.1% of patients with UC (adalimumab 23.0%, infliximab 44.8%, ustekinumab 25.5%, vedolizumab 31.8%, tofacitinib 24.9%). Patients with evidence of dose escalation had lower rates of discontinuation compared with nonescalators over follow-up but were more likely to switch biologics after discontinuation. PPPM IBD-related health care costs over the course of treatment were substantial and largely driven by index biologic costs. Mean PPPM costs for the CD cohort ranged from $4,543 in the infliximab group to $14,031 in the ustekinumab group; costs were similar in the UC cohort, ranging from $5,213 in the infliximab group to $14,246 in the ustekinumab group. Within both cohorts, dose escalation was a significant predictor of increased IBD-related health care costs.<br><br>Nearly one-third of patients with IBD in this study escalated their biologic dose, which significantly increased their disease-related health care costs. These results demonstrate current challenges in long-term biologic therapy in IBD and highlight the ongoing need for further research into biologic management strategies to optimize IBD patient care and long-term outcomes, while containing costs.</div>

            <div class="abs">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. The secretome, encompassing proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, has emerged as a promising tool for early detection, risk stratification, and therapeutic targeting in HCC. Recent studies suggest that secretome-derived biomarkers improve diagnostic accuracy and predict survival outcomes. However, variability in methodologies and findings necessitates a comprehensive synthesis of evidence.<br><br>A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were searched on 2 May 2025 for studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of the secretome in HCC. Eligibility criteria included original research reporting sensitivity, specificity, or survival outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed via I² statistics.<br><br>Five studies met the inclusion criteria. The secretome demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with a pooled sensitivity of 95.9% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 40-100] and specificity of 89.6% (95% CI: 43.1-99). Moderate heterogeneity (I² = 44%) was observed.

            <div class="abs">Cystic fibrosis (CF) alters gut physiology, yet its impact on microbial communities across colonic regions (ascending, transverse, descending colon) and microhabitats (lumen, mucosa) remains incompletely understood. Here, we applied culturomics to characterize gut microbiota in a small cohort of 32 individuals (22 non-CF, 10 CF). Persons with CF (pwCF) exhibited significantly higher viable bacterial loads than non-CF individuals, particularly in mucosal samples. Anaerobes predominated overall, with relative enrichment of aerobes in the mucosa of pwCF. Alpha diversity was reduced in mucosal samples and aerobic cultures for pwCF, whereas beta diversity was influenced by all the tested variables except the colonic region. Phylum-level analyses revealed enrichment of Proteobacteria and depletion of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes in samples from pwCF, consistent with stool analysis.

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) increases cardiovascular and pancreatitis risk. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies like volanesorsen and olezarsen target ApoC-III mRNA to reduce ApoC-III, enhancing lipoprotein lipase activity and lowering triglycerides (TGs). This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of these ASOs in severe HTG. A systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42024577110) was conducted following PRISMA, sourcing studies from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving severe HTG (≥200 mg/dL) treated with volanesorsen or olezarsen vs. placebo were included. Data were synthesized using a random effects model in RevMan 5.4, and bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool. Of 31 identified articles, 9 RCTs (341 patients treated with ASOs, 209 controls) were included. ASOs significantly reduced TG levels [mean difference (MD): -53.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): -77.04 to -30.40; p<0.00001]. Reductions were also seen in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD: -55.76; p<0.00001), ApoC-III (MD: -74.78; p<0.00001), and APOB48 (MD: -69.45; p<0.00001). Olezarsen uniquely reduced APOB (MD: -15.60; p<0.00001). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased (MD: -23.25; p<0.00001), while HDL-C increased (MD: +42.14; p<0.00001). Volanesorsen was linked to higher low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (MD: +62.74; p=0.004). For safety, local injection reactions, thrombocytopenia, and nausea were more common with volanesorsen. Acute pancreatitis occurred only in the placebo group (relative risk: 0.15; p=0.0004), indicating ASO protection. This meta-analysis confirms that ASOs effectively lower TGs and improve lipid profiles in severe HTG.</div>

            <div class='btm-box'><b>💡 Conclusion</b><br>Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are an approved cancer therapy for glioblastoma (GBM), pleural mesothelioma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent phase 3 trial of TTFields therapy concomitant with standard-of-care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Gem/NabP) as a first-line treatment for unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma demonstrated a significant increase in overall survival. The current study evaluated the effects of TTFields in preclinical pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models. The vast majority of PDAC patients harbor KRAS mutations, which are associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype and increased therapy resistance, driven in part by overexpression of the key transcription factor c-Myc. In the current study, TTFields application significantly suppressed c-Myc expression and induced immunogenic cell death (ICD)-characterized by increased calreticulin cell-surface exposure, extracellular ATP secretion, and elevated HMGB1 release-in pancreatic cancer models. These effects were further enhanced when TTFields were applied concomitantly with Gem/NabP. Causality between c-Myc modulation and immune readouts was not established. In vivo, TTFields application induced a systemic immune response, evidenced by dendritic cell activation, increased effector memory T cells, and greater tumor leukocyte infiltration. TTFields concomitant with Gem/NabP significantly reduced tumor volume, decreased tumor monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC), and increased the tumor lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) compared to all other treatment groups. These findings support the potential of TTFields to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, TTFields-induced tumor immunogenicity may enable combination strategies with immunotherapies. A phase 2 clinical trial investigating TTFields with Gem/NabP and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for metastatic PDAC is currently underway.</div>

            <div class="abs">Dual mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and autophagy inhibition shows synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical models of RAS-mutant cancers. We hypothesized that autophagy blockade with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could overcome resistance to MEK inhibition with binimetinib (BINI) and provide clinical benefit in previously treated, KRAS-mutated, metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).<br><br>This investigator-led, single-arm, open-label, phase I dose escalation/expansion trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of BINI + HCQ in patients with previously treated, metastatic PDAC (NCT04132505). Key eligibility criteria: ECOG 0-1, adequate organ function, ≥ 1 prior line of therapy for metastatic disease, and presence of KRAS mutation. Dose escalation followed a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design. The primary endpoint was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).<br><br>From December 2019 to August 2024, 34 patients were enrolled in dose escalation (n = 17) and dose expansion (n = 17). Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred among the first 3 patients treated at dose level 1 (BINI 45 mg + HCQ 600 mg): grade 3 creatine phosphokinase elevation with renal impairment (BINI) and grade 3 QT prolongation (HCQ). Following dose de-escalation due to poor tolerance, the MTD was determined to be BINI 30 mg + HCQ 600 mg twice daily and used in expansion. Out of 31 response-evaluable patients, 2 patients achieved a partial response and 9 patients achieved stable disease, yielding ORR 6.5% and DCR 35.5%, respectively. Median PFS was 1.9 months, and median OS was 5.3 months.<br><br>The combination of BINI + HCQ demonstrated a challenging toxicity profile and limited clinical activity in patients with chemorefractory metastatic PDAC.</div>
